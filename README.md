# Data-Science-And-Big-Data-Analytics

Notes and code from Data Science and Big Data Analytics: Making Data-Driven Decisions, a course by MIT xPro. For each mododule there is a markdown file with notes, and then some Jupyter notebooks for the Case Studies.  Also, the numbering comes from the course, which is why it's not contiguous.
