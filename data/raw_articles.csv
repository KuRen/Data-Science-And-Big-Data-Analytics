0,WORLD,"U.S. To Lift Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum From Canada And Mexico

The Trump administration has reached a deal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, in a move that could put the nations a step closer to ratifying the USMCA — the trade deal that would update the NAFTA agreement.

The tariffs will be lifted within two days, according to a joint U.S.-Canada statement posted by Canada's foreign ministry.

The U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico have now been in effect for nearly a year, subjecting steel imports to a 25% tariff and aluminum to a 10% hike. Retaliatory tariffs from both countries have been in place for nearly as long.

""I'm pleased to announce that we've just reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico"" to end the recent tariffs, Trump said in a speech at a National Association of REALTORS event Friday.

Trump then called on Congress to ratify the USMCA, to ""make our economy even more successful than it already is — if that's possible. Which, it is possible.""

Discussing the breakthrough Friday afternoon, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, ""There was no one breakthrough moment"" in the talks.

During an outing to the Stelco steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario, Trudeau told reporters that he had ""lots of conversations with the [U.S.] president over the past weeks, and understanding as well that these tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border.""

And with both countries' leaders now hoping to get the USMCA ratified, Trudeau said, ""it didn't make a lot of sense to continue to have tariffs on steel and aluminum between our countries.""

Trudeau spoke to President Trump about a deal to end the tariffs around midday, according to Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau's director of communications.

The joint statement says the U.S. and Canada will establish a way to monitor aluminum and steel trade between them, with an eye to prevent the ""transshipment"" of aluminum and steel that was produced by a third country.

The deal also calls on the two countries to prevent the importation of aluminum and steel that is ""unfairly subsidized and/or sold at dumped prices.""

The agreement also leaves room for tariffs to be instated ""imports of aluminum or steel products surge meaningfully beyond historic volumes of trade over a period of time, with consideration of market share.""

""Canada buys more American steel than any other country in the world, accounting for some 50% of U.S. exports,"" the Canadian government says. It adds that nearly 84% of Canadian aluminum production is exported to the U.S.

In response to the tariff deal, the Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users, or CAMMU, welcomed the news, and called on the Trump administration to lift other steel and aluminum sanctions, as well. The group was formed to advocate against Trump's metal tariffs. It represents some 30,000 companies through businesses and trade associations.

""These tariffs are damaging the U.S. manufacturing sector, and particularly downstream U.S. steel and aluminum consuming companies, by increasing prices and lead times for both domestic and imports of steel and aluminum and making the U.S. an island of high steel prices,"" the coalition said in a statement sent to NPR Friday.

CAMMU also praised the new steel agreement for not replacing the newly eliminated tariffs with quotas, which it described as ""even worse for U.S. companies.""

Trump ordered the first round of steel and aluminum tariffs roughly a month after receiving a letter from 25 U.S. steel and metal companies urging him to act ""to prevent excess steel capacity and surging steel imports from undermining our national security and the viability of the U.S. steel industry.""

Trump's original tariff order targeted the EU, exempting the closest U.S. neighbors. But after extended talks on a revised NAFTA deal took longer than the U.S. administration had hoped, the two countries were included in the tariffs. The leaders of the three countries signed the new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement in late November. It won't take effect until all three legislatures have voted to ratify the trade pact.

In late April, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, warned Trump that the USMCA deal would be ""dead"" unless the steel and aluminum tariffs were lifted.

News of a deal to undo the tariffs comes two days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a deal was looming, during his testimony to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.

Earlier this week, Mexico's Economy Secretary Graciela Marquez said she believed a solution to the tariff standoff could be imminent, as she held meetings in Toronto with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.",U.S. To Lift Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum From Canada And Mexico
1,WORLD,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said she looks forward to a briefing next week that will provide more clarity on the rising tensions between the United States and Iran, and warned that a war with the country would dwarf the challenges of the Iraq War.

The Hawaii congresswoman, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful and veteran of the Army National Guard, told ""Fox News at Night"" host Shannon Bream that she has seen first-hand the cost of war, and that the ""devastation and cost"" of a war with Iran would be ""far greater than anything we've experienced before.""

As a combat veteran and former member of the House committees on foreign affairs and national security, Gabbard argued that she knew all too well the ""high human cost of war.""

""In these wars across the Middle East and Iraq, thousands of my brothers and sisters in uniform lost their lives and many were injured,"" she said.

""I also know the cost on the American people,"" she continued. ""The trillions of dollars we spent since 9/11 on waging wasteful regime-change wars, how those wars have undermined our national security and how they have strengthened ISIS and Al Qaeda.""

President Trump has taken action in recent weeks in response to what he's deemed ""credible threats"" from Iran. On Thursday, a commander of Iran’s Quds Force allegedly told Iran-backed militias in Iraq to “prepare for proxy war” amid rising tensions with the United States.

Gabbard expressed her concern that it appeared the United States is ""walking dangerously"" down the path to war with Iran, which she said would have devastating consequences.

""What is important that the American people know is a war with Iran would make the war in Iraq look like a cakewalk,"" she said.

COTTON SAYS AMERICA WOULD WIN WAR AGAINST IRAN IN 'TWO STRIKES'

President Trump and his administration have consistently maintained that they want to avoid a war with Iran, but Gabbard argued that their actions are speaking louder than words.

""While Trump and others in his administration are saying they don't want to go to war with Iran, I hear them saying that more now that they are getting a lot of pushback from our allies like those in the U.K., when in fact the actions of the administration have been telling us another story,"" she continued.

3,WORLD,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are “highly likely” to have facilitated attacks last Sunday on four tankers including two Saudi ships off Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, according to a Norwegian insurers’ report seen by Reuters.

The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Norway are investigating the attacks, which also hit a UAE- and a Norwegian-flagged vessel.

A confidential assessment issued this week by the Norwegian Shipowners’ Mutual War Risks Insurance Association (DNK) concluded that the attack was likely to have been carried out by a surface vessel operating close by that despatched underwater drones carrying 30-50 kg (65-110 lb) of high-grade explosives to detonate on impact.

The attacks took place against a backdrop of U.S.-Iranian tension following Washington’s decision this month to try to cut Tehran’s oil exports to zero and beef up its military presence in the Gulf in response to what it called Iranian threats.

The DNK based its assessment that the IRGC was likely to have orchestrated the attacks on a number of factors, including:

- A high likelihood that the IRGC had previously supplied its allies, the Houthi militia fighting a Saudi-backed government in Yemen, with explosive-laden surface drone boats capable of homing in on GPS navigational positions for accuracy.

- The similarity of shrapnel found on the Norwegian tanker to shrapnel from drone boats used off Yemen by Houthis, even though the craft previously used by the Houthis were surface boats rather than the underwater drones likely to have been deployed in Fujairah.

- The fact that Iran and particularly the IRGC had recently threatened to use military force and that, against a militarily stronger foe, they were highly likely to choose “asymmetric measures with plausible deniability”. DNK noted that the Fujairah attack had caused “relatively limited damage” and had been carried out at a time when U.S. Navy ships were still en route to the Gulf.

Both the Saudi-flagged crude oil tanker Amjad and the UAE-flagged bunker vessel A.Michel sustained damage in the area of their engine rooms, while the Saudi tanker Al Marzoqah was damaged in the aft section and the Norwegian tanker Andrea Victory suffered extensive damage to the stern, DNK said.

The DNK report said the attacks had been carried out between six and 10 nautical miles off Fujairah, which lies close to the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran has in the past threatened to block all exports through the Strait of Hormuz, through which an estimated fifth of the world’s oil passes.

According to DNK, it was highly likely that the attacks had been intended to send a message to the United States and its allies that Iran did not need to block the Strait to disrupt freedom of navigation in the region.

DNK said Iran was also likely to continue similar low-scale attacks on merchant vessels in the coming period.

Iranian officials and the Revolutionary Guards’ (IRGC) spokesman were not available for comment.

Tehran had already rejected allegations of involvement and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said that “extremist individuals” in the U.S. government were pursuing dangerous policies. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.

DNK’s managing director Svein Ringbakken declined to comment, except to say that “this is an internal and confidential report produced to inform shipowner members of the DNK about the incidents in Fujairah and the most likely explanation”.

The UAE has not blamed anyone for the attack.

Two U.S. government sources said this week that U.S. officials believed Iran had encouraged Houthi militants or Iraq-based Shi’ite militias to carry out the attack.

In a joint letter seen by Reuters and sent to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Norway said the attacks had been deliberate and could have resulted in casualties, spillages of oil or harmful chemicals.

“The attacks damaged the hulls of at least three of the vessels, threatened the safety and lives of those on board, and could have led to an environmental disaster,” the letter said.

Last month, the United States designated the entire IRGC as a terrorist organization. Washington had previously designated entities and individuals connected with the IRGC, which controls vast segments of Iran’s economy.

4,WORLD,"Thousands of marriage-equality advocates celebrated Friday in the pouring rain outside Taiwan’s legislature as it voted to become the first in Asia to fully legalize same-sex unions.

The law — which allows for same-sex couples to apply for “marriage registration” as part of “exclusive permanent unions” — came a week before Taiwan’s codes barring same-sex marriage would have been automatically dropped by court order.

Lawmakers had faced pressure from both LGBT groups demanding sweeping reforms and religious groups and others opposing the changes. Friday’s 66-27 vote recognizes same-sex marriages and gives couples many of the tax, insurance and child custody benefits available to male-female married couples.

Taiwan’s high court ruled on May 24, 2017, that barring same-sex couples from marrying violates the Taiwanese constitution and gave the legislature two years to pass a corresponding law or see same-sex marriage become legalized automatically.

The process frequently stalled amid conservative opposition. But in November 2018, Taiwan voted in a public referendum to deny same-sex couples full marriage rights.

Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) responded by submitting legislation designed to comply with both the court ruling and the referendum result. Two competing bills that would be less favorable to the gay community were submitted, but they failed to gain traction.

The law could give the DPP and President Tsai Ing-wen a boost ahead of a presidential election in January. Gay rights advocates have long criticized the ruling party for failing to pass legislation sooner, but these concerns were largely absent amid the mood of optimism at Friday’s rally.

Chi Chia-wei, a gay rights activist for more than 30 years, said he was “very, very happy” to see Taiwan legalize same-sex marriage, calling the process “a strong demonstration of our democratic spirit.”

Friday’s legislation brought a wave of euphoria over a large crowd outside Taiwan’s legislature. Many attendees arrived in buses from outlying cities and stood under umbrellas in a torrential downpour as legislators voted on the articles that would make up Asia’s first same-sex marriage legislation.

The law ensures that Taiwan would stand as an example for Asia’s LGBT community. Thailand has proposed a law to recognize civil partnerships, but same-sex unions remain illegal elsewhere in Asia.

Jay Lin, chief executive of Portico Media and a gay father of two children, called the law a “beacon of hope” for Asia’s gay community. “I’m very glad that I’m living in Taiwan and I’m a beneficiary of these new laws,” he said.

[In historic decision, Taiwanese court rules in favor of same-sex marriage]

In neighboring China — which asserts sovereignty over Taiwan — popular LGBTQ microblogs were censored online in the wake of Taiwan’s 2017 high court ruling. The social media platform Weibo was criticized last month for restricting LGBTQ hashtags.

Taiwan has shown that “traditional culture is not against LGBT culture,” said Jennifer Lu, coordinator of the rights group Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan. “That’s the message we want to send to the world.”

Before Friday’s vote, legislators in Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party had rallied to promote a bill that would not define same-sex unions as “marriages.” On Thursday evening, the DPP amended its draft legislation to remove references to “same-sex marriages” while ensuring that same-sex couples would nonetheless be allowed to register marriages.

Tsai, the president, voiced her support of the legislation in a Twitter post, saying that Friday marked “a chance to make history and show the world that progressive values can take root in an Asian society.”

The ruling DPP holds 68 of the 113 seats in Taiwan’s legislature. Tsai’s premier and the party’s caucus whip had worked relentlessly over the past week to secure enough support for the legislation to pass.

Hundreds of couples have already registered to marry on May 24, the deadline set by the high court, but they have not known exactly what rights they would be afforded as newly married couples.

Taiwan’s new law grants same-sex couples the right to marry outside its civil code, which governs marriage rights for heterosexual couples. This was done to comply with the 2017 court ruling as well as the November 2018 referendum, in which voters decided that the civil code should restrict marriage to being between a man and a woman.

KMT legislators had called for Taiwan to respect the referendum results by voting in favor of an alternative bill that would limit same-sex unions to “familiar relationships” and would not consider same-sex partners to be spouses.

A third bill, proposed by DPP legislator Lin Tai-hua, contained a controversial clause that would allow family members to request that a same-sex union be annulled.

Gay rights advocates have called for full adoption rights for same-sex couples, who are barred from adopting non-blood relatives under the new law.

An amendment proposed by the New Power Party (NPP), a minor political party aligned most closely with the DPP, would have allowed Taiwanese nationals to enter same-sex unions with partners from countries that do not recognize same-sex marriage. It was rejected by DPP legislators.

Lu said the law represents a major step forward for Taiwan’s gay community, especially considering the strong conservative backlash to the 2017 high court decision. “I think the result is an accomplishment at this stage,” she said. “But we will keep on fighting for full marriage rights.”

Taiwan’s 2020 election campaign is already kicking off. It’s all about the U.S. and China.

7,WORLD,"President Trump is not backing down in his trade war. After initially raising tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods coming from China, the Trump administration also hiked tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of goods.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said: ""We're having a little squabble with China because we've been treated very unfairly for many, many decades or actually a long time, and it should've been handled a long time ago, and it wasn't, and we'll handle it now. I think it's going to turn out extremely well. We're in a very strong position.""

The additional tariffs come after China announced it will raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods coming from the United States. Trump is excited about this escalating trade war. Others in Washington are not.

Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, both Republicans, have expressed concern and pessimism over Trump’s trade policy, especially when it comes to agriculture. The state they both represent, Iowa, ranks second in the nation in terms of agricultural exports between corn, soybeans, pork, and eggs. It’s also the nation’s leader in producing and exporting corn and ethanol, a biofuel additive for gasoline.

Meanwhile, the 2020 Democratic candidates are pinning all the blame on Trump.

Following the news of the initial tariffs being raised, Joe Biden told reporters in New Hampshire this week, ""The president has done nothing but increase the tariffs, the debt, and the trade deficit. The way we have to proceed is we have to have our allies with us. It’s not just us. We have to keep the world together.” Earlier in May, Biden said that China are not bad folks and are not competition for the U.S.

The problem here is that many Democrats, like Biden, are pretending there's a moral equivalence between China and the U.S.

China is an authoritarian state run by the Communist Party. The Chinese people simply don’t have the same freedoms as Americans. Political dissent is punished. Freedom of religion is a farce.

Consider the Uighur Muslims, a religious and ethnic minority in the western province of Xinjiang, who have been persecuted by the Chinese government for practicing Islam. In addition to being subject to increased surveillance in daily life that includes owning books about Uighurs, growing a beard, having a prayer rug, or even quitting smoking or drinking, over a million Uighur Muslims are imprisoned in “re-education camps,” which can be argued as modern-day concentration camps.

Looking at the bigger picture, Trump’s trade war could be the extent of how far he’s willing to go with China. Yes, U.S. farmers and consumers will arguably be hurt by the tariffs. But China is a bad actor that has no interest in making the lives of Americans better. All they care about is expanding and cementing their power on the world stage. American politicians on both sides of the aisle should be quick to remember that.","Amid US-China trade war, Americans need to know who they're dealing with"
8,WORLD,"Hanging over the current disagreement is the debate over the Iraq war and, specifically, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell’s address to the United Nations in 2003. Mr. Powell’s presentation included fuzzy images and partial communications intercepts, and detailed what came to be understood as wildly wrong assessments about the Iraqi government’s illicit weapons.

In the debate over Iran, Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced legislation to require the Trump administration to get congressional approval before “engaging in hostilities” with Iran. In April, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, pressed Mr. Pompeo during a hearing for the same commitment, but the secretary of state deflected the request.

Most Republicans signaled they supported the administration’s tough line. “Iran seems to be more aggressive, and we have to push back,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said after meeting with intelligence officials. “We cannot give them a lot of space.”

Divisions over the intelligence extended to American allies.

Troops from Germany and the Netherlands were pulled back to bases in Iraq. Spanish defense officials, to avoid entanglement in any upcoming conflict with Iran, withdrew a frigate that was part of the American-led carrier strike group heading to the Persian Gulf. Training efforts by France and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are continuing as normal.

The State Department ordered “nonemergency U.S. government employees” at both the embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Erbil, the Kurdish capital, to leave the country. The order applied primarily to full-time diplomats posted to Iraq; an embassy statement said that visa services in Iraq would be suspended as a result. Contractors who provide security, food and other such services will remain in place for now.

Mr. Pompeo shared some details of the intelligence with Iraqi leaders on May 7 when he made a surprise visit to Baghdad. But American officials in Washington said the most delicate intelligence was not shared with the Iraqis for fear their agencies have been penetrated by Iranian spies.

Tensions with Iran have been rising since May 2018, when Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal that world powers reached with Tehran.

9,WORLD,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States must show sincerity if it is to hold meaningful trade talks, China said on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump dramatically raised the stakes with a potentially devastating blow to Chinese tech giant Huawei.

China has yet to say whether or how it will retaliate against the latest escalation in trade tension, although state media has taken an increasingly strident tone, with the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily publishing a front-page commentary that evoked the patriotic spirit of past wars.

China’s currency slid to its weakest in almost five months, although losses were capped after sources told Reuters that the central bank would ensure the yuan did not weaken past the key 7-per-dollar level in the immediate term.

The world’s two largest economies are locked in an increasingly acrimonious trade dispute that has seen them level escalating tariffs on each other’s imports in the midst of negotiations, adding to fears about risks to global growth and knocking financial markets.

Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about state media reports suggesting there would be no more U.S.-China trade talks, said China always encouraged resolving disputes between the two countries with dialogue and consultations.

“But because of certain things the U.S. side has done during the previous China-U.S. trade consultations, we believe if there is meaning for these talks, there must be a show of sincerity,” he told a daily news briefing.

The United States should observe the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and they must also keep their word, Lu said, without elaborating.

On Thursday, Washington put telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, one of China’s biggest and most successful companies, on a blacklist that could make it extremely difficult for the telecom giant to do business with U.S. companies.

That followed Trump’s decision on May 5 to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, a major escalation after the two sides appeared to have been close to reaching a deal in negotiations to end their trade battle.

China can be expected to make preparations for a longer-term trade war with the United States, said a Chinese government official with knowledge of the situation.

“Indeed, this is an important moment, but not an existential, live-or-die moment,” the official said.

“In the short term, the trade situation between China and the United States will be severe, and there will be challenges. Neither will it be smooth in the long run. This will spur China to make adequate preparations in the long term.”

The impact of trade friction on China’s economy is “controllable”, the state planner said on Friday, pledging to take countermeasures as needed, Meng Wei, a spokeswoman for the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC), told a media briefing.

The South China Morning Post, citing an unidentified source, reported that a senior member of China’s ruling Communist Party said the trade war with the United States could reduce China’s 2019 growth by 1 percentage point in the worst-case scenario.

Wang Yang, the fourth-most senior member of the Communist Party’s seven-member Standing Committee, the top decision-making body, told a delegation of Taiwan businessmen on Thursday that the trade war would have an impact but would not lead to any structural changes, the paper said, citing an unidentified source who was at the meeting.

One company that says it has been making preparations is Huawei’s Hisilicon unit, which purchases U.S. semiconductors for its parent.

Its president told staff in a letter on Friday that the company had been secretly developing back-up products for years in case Huawei was one day unable to obtain the advanced chips and technology it buys from the United States.

“Today, the wheel of destiny has turned and we have arrived at this extreme and dark moment, as a super-nation ruthlessly disrupts the world’s technology and industry system,” the company president said in the letter.

The letter was widely shared on Chinese social media, gaining 180 million impressions in the few hours after it was published on the Weibo microblogging site.

“Go Huawei! Our country’s people will always support you,” wrote one Weibo user after reading the letter.","After Huawei blow, China says must show sincerity for talks"

Qassem Soleimani, a commander of Iran’s extraterritorial military operations Quds Force, called for a meeting with the militias three weeks ago, but the exact timing of the gathering remains unclear, the Guardian reported Thursday.

“It wasn’t a call to arms, but it wasn’t far off,” a senior intelligence source told the newspaper.

UK FOLLOWS US LEAD, RAISES THREAT LEVEL IN IRAQ DUE TO THREAT FROM IRAN

The meeting likely played a role in the Trump administration’s decision this week to pull all non-essential government staff from Iraq. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraqi officials that Iran-backed militias have moved their missiles near to the bases housing Americans.

Other countries soon followed the threat assessment of the U.S., with Britain raising threat levels for its troops in Iraq on Thursday. Both Germany and the Netherlands suspended a training mission in Iraq.

But intelligence collected by the U.S. government appears to also suggest that both Iran and the U.S. may have misread each other as being offensive rather than defensive, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Iran apparently thought the U.S. was planning an attack on Iran, which prompted the regime to prepare for counterstrikes.

MIKE POMPEO SAID IRAN-BACKED MILITIAS MOVED ROCKETS NEAR AMERICAN BASES IN IRAQ

At the same time, some within the Trump administration say that the same intelligence also suggests that Iran was planning to strike first. Such intelligence may have formed the basis of Pompeo’s claim during his meeting with the Iraqi top brass.

Iran has recently threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal and resume higher uranium enrichment if no new deal is put in place, while Pompeo told the Iraqi top brass that U.S. intelligence showed Iran-backed militias moved missiles near bases housing American forces.

Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Zarif, on Thursday deemed new sanctions imposed by the Trump administration as “unacceptable” but noted that the country is committed to the nuclear deal.

“We believe that escalation by the United States is unacceptable and uncalled for. We have exercised maximum restraints,” he said during a visit to Japan.

American military experts have also suggested that “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Sunday. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, accused Tehran of ordering “the terrorist acts” against their oil pipeline, a drone attack that was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-allied Houthi rebels.

11,WORLD,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday granted a full pardon to Conrad Black, a former newspaper publisher who has written a flattering political biography of Trump.

Black's media empire once included the Chicago Sun-Times and The Daily Telegraph of London. He was convicted of fraud in 2007 and spent three and a half years in prison. An appeals court reversed two convictions, but left two others in place.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Black ""has made tremendous contributions to business, and to political and historical thought.""

In 2018, Black published ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other."" He wrote a column Wednesday in Canada's National Post describing how Trump called him and revealed the pardon.

""He could not have been more gracious and quickly got to his point: he was granting me a full pardon,"" wrote Black, who used much of the rest of the column to explain the case. He called it a long ordeal that was ""never anything but a confluence of unlucky events, the belligerence of several corporate governance charlatans, and grandstanding local and American judges, all fanned by an unusually frenzied international media showing exceptional interest in the case because I was a media owner.""

In 2015, Black wrote a National Review essay titled ""Trump Is the Good Guy."" Trump tweeted it was an ""honor"" to read the piece, adding, ""As one of the truly great intellects & my friend, I won't forget!""

The former media mogul was convicted of defrauding investors. A former member of the British House of Lords, he was sentenced to more than six years in prison after his 2007 conviction in Chicago, but was released on bail two years later to pursue an appeal that was partially successful. A judge reduced his sentence to three years.

Sanders said Black is the author of several notable biographies, including volumes on Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon, but she did not mention his book about Trump.

She said Black's case attracted broad support from many high-profile individuals — including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elton John and Rush Limbaugh — who have ""vigorously vouched for his exceptional character.""

Trump on Wednesday also pardoned Patrick Nolan, a former Republican leader of the California State Assembly. Nolan has been a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform since he spent more than two years in federal prison during the 1990s.

Sanders said Nolan wrote a guide for churches and community groups to help prisoners return to their communities. While incarcerated, he also helped organize religious-study groups and he is ""uniformly described as a man of principle and integrity,"" she said.

13,WORLD,"JERUSALEM — Israel has been providing Washington with intelligence about potential Iranian attacks. Its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made Iran’s strategic ambitions an obsession. And as recently as February he floated the idea of war with Iran.

But analysts and former Israeli military and intelligence officials say the Israeli government is not angling for a full-blown war between the United States and Iran. Such a war, Israeli officials fear, could plunge Israel into a mutually destructive conflagration with Iran’s ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah.

The insistent pressure on Iran, analysts said, is instead aimed at either forcing Iran to agree to a nuclear deal far stricter than the existing one, or creating conditions dire enough for fed-up Iranians to overthrow their government.

[In the Middle East, fears that the Trump administration is building a flawed case for conflict.]

“Nobody thinks about regime change militarily, but to weaken the regime, to weaken the Iranian economy, and to make the people of Iran change the regime — this is, I think, the ultimate goal,” said Amos Yadlin, a retired head of Israeli military intelligence who runs the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “Another very positive result is a better agreement.”","Israel Presses the Case Against Iran, but Not for War"
14,WORLD,"The Palestinian foreign minister has branded the anticipated US plan for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict an unacceptable ""surrender act"".

Riad Malki said the plan that Donald Trump calls the ""deal of the century"" was in fact ""the consecration of [Palestinians'] century-old ordeal"".

No confirmed details have been revealed of the plan, which Washington says could be unveiled next month.

Israel has not officially taken a position towards the plan.

Earlier this month Mr Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is an architect of the plan, said the proposals will be a ""framework... [which] will lead to both sides being much better off"".

It is unclear whether the plan will be based on the so-called ""two-state solution"" - a long-standing formula for resolving the conflict by creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel, with Jerusalem a shared capital.
• How is Trump's peace plan going?

The Palestinians and most of the international community support this approach in principle, while the Israeli leadership is cooler towards it.

Speaking at Chatham House think tank in London, Mr Malki said all the indications were that ""this [US] administration is preparing to give its stamp of approval to Israel's colonial policies...

""When it comes to taking the lead on peace efforts, the world left the steering wheel in the hand of a reckless driver... with a view that we should wait till the reckless driver goes over a cliff or runs over the Palestinian people [before doing] something about it.""

The Palestinians often describe Israeli settlement and other activity in the occupied territories as a form of colonialism, a characterisation which Israel strongly rejects.

Israel has built about 140 settlements, home to more than 600,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since it occupied them in the 1967 Middle East war.

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

Mr Malki said the Trump administration's plan offered ""no independence, no sovereignty, no freedom and no justice - and if [the US] do not think that this situation will have an impact on the future of Israel and the region one way or another, they are the ones that are delusional and not us"".

Inferring that acceptance of the Trump plan would be ""capitulation"", the foreign minister said the Palestinians would ""never be ready to sign a surrender act"".

""This is a defining moment,"" he said. ""If you think action [to resist the plan] is too costly, just think of the alternative and of the path it would set us on for decades to come.

Khartoum, Sudan — Weeks into the protests that would eventually topple Sudan's dictator, the government realized it had an unprecedented problem on its hands: the number of women in the streets calling for change far outnumbered the men.

So the regime's top brass sent a chilling message down to its officers on the ground: ""Break the girls, because if you break the girls, you break the men.""

What followed, several officials told CNN, was a systematic attempt to target the women at the heart of the biggest anti-government protests in decades.

In the early months of the uprising, soldiers began to arrest women on the front lines in the capital Khartoum and, activists say, take them to secret detention sites, where they were photographed naked and threatened with sexual violence.

But as Omar al-Bashir's 30-year grip on power began to slip, soldiers began to make good on their threats. Some women were beaten senseless by police in public. Others were dragged into the vehicles of security forces and raped, the activists said.

The orders from the regime were clear, according to one intelligence officer. ""We all know what it means to break a girl,"" he told CNN.

The assaults set off a ripple-effect of abuse -- husbands began to divorce their wives out of shame, and fathers beat their daughters into submission, in an attempt to keep them at home.

But time and time again, the women returned to the streets, throwing tear gas canisters back at the military, climbing atop car roofs to urge the protesters on, and manning food and drink stalls to help in any way they could.

While their fearlessness and sheer numbers -- by some estimates women accounted for up to 70% of demonstrators -- made them a target, they were beaten, but not broken.

Bashir was finally forced out last month, but the military-led transitional council that replaced him is refusing to hand over power to civilians. The protests haven't stopped and the fight for democracy is far from over, but the women who played a key role in the dictator's downfall have already paid a heavy price for their bravery.

The Sudanese government has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

The recent wave of anti-government demonstrations in Sudan began late last year over the rising cost of living, but quickly escalated into nationwide calls for Bashir's removal.

In the early days of the protests in Khartoum, security forces attempted to intimidate female activists by threatening to ruin their reputations.

Officers warned them that their whole neighborhood would know they were ""loose"" when they were being dropped off in police cars late at night, according to protester Wifaq Quraishi.

Before long, the verbal insults turned into psychological abuse, with officers forcing women into compromising positions and then documenting it.

Quraishi told CNN she was ""subjected to many detentions"" during her three-month involvement in the uprising, each of them different.

A detention could involve ""blackmail,"" ""taking photographs of you naked,"" or ""the threat of rape,"" she said.

Quraishi said during body searches she was made to strip naked in front of a camera. ""Photographs were taken of me when I was getting undressed -- I was told that it was a search over which I had no authority,"" the 27-year-old added.

Quraishi had ""no idea"" where the photos would end up, but said she heard stories of women being threatened by the compromising images.

""In reality these pictures may not even exist,"" she said. ""But that is blackmail.""

As the protests escalated, so did the violence. One day, Quraishi said she was attacked by a security official at Khartoum University, her alma mater and a place she'd previously considered safe. The man hit her with the butt of his rifle so hard that he ""dislocated my jaw, and my eye was full of blood.""

Another protester, Rifga Abdelrahman, said her friends were ""beaten up, their hair shaved off, insulted, treated in a way that no Sudanese girl should be treated.""

This week, during a resurgence of violence in the capital, activist Nidal Ahmed was filming security forces firing on protesters when she was set upon by a group of soldiers. They hit her with batons and sticks as they attempted to take her camera, which captured the incident.

""As soon as I could gain my strength and stand, they beat me on my backside and said 'run!' This happened to all the girls -- they hit them and told them to run,"" she said. ""This was a very painful thing.""

The last scene of Ahmed's footage shows a soldier leaning over her body on the ground, his outstretched palm covering the camera lens.

In some cases, the abuse went even further. At least 15 women have reported being raped during the uprising, according to Nahed Jabrallah, one of the demonstrators and the founder of SEEMA, a charity tackling violence against women and child marriage.

Some of the assaults involved ""raping the victim anally or vaginally,"" and some of them took place in the ""presence of more than one person,"" Jabrallah said. Given the stigma associated with sexual abuse in Sudan, the true number is likely to be much higher.

Quraishi didn't see or tell her family about the incident at the university for a month for fear of repercussions ""worse than being beaten up by police."" And despite her family's attempts to prevent her from protesting, she was back on the streets within days.

""We have a saying,"" Quraishi said. ""The oppression is what moves you, meaning that it motivates you.

""We are oppressed at home, oppressed on the street, at university, at work, on public transport,"" she said. ""All of these things made the girls go out to demonstrate on the street.""

Khartoum became the epicenter of the protests, and by the spring, mass rallies and sit-ins outside the presidential compound and army headquarters were held almost daily.

Abdelrahman was arrested five times, managing to escape detention each time so that she could ""go back on the street again and throw back tear gas grenades.""

""I wasn't intimidated by their threats or by the way they treated us,"" said the 18-year-old.

The bravery of the female protesters took their male counterparts by surprise. During one rally in Khartoum, the men attempted to surround the women to protect them from the police truncheons and tear gas. But the women broke free and insisted on standing on the front line, Quraishi said.

""In their minds they thought that women didn't run, and it wasn't a very good thing,"" she explained. But ""we stood firmly in the square, so that they had to as well.""

In rally after rally, demonstrators sang ""rise up, the revolution is a woman."" During one sit-in in April, a young woman clad in a white robe and wearing gold earrings clambered up onto the roof of a car to address the crowd. Images of the scene quickly came to symbolize the energy of the protests, and women's role in them.

The woman, 22-year-old journalist and activist Alaa Salah, told CNN that she ""wanted to speak on behalf of the youth ... I wanted to come out and say that Sudan is for all.""

Salah's outfit was a nod to the proud history of female activists in Sudan, long before Islamists took power. The thobe, as it is called in Sudan, is a throwback to ""the clothing worn by our mothers and grandmothers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s"" while demonstrating against previous military dictatorships, said Sudanese social commentator Hind Makki.

People across the country began referring to female protesters as ""Kandaka"" -- the title given to the ""Nubian queens of ancient Sudan, whose gift to their descendants is a legacy of empowered women who fight hard for their country and their rights,"" Makki said.

In early April, when security forces attempted to break up a sit-in outside the presidential compound in Khartoum, some soldiers stepped in to defend them. It was a sign that Bashir's days were numbered.

Several army officers told CNN that the abuse of women protesters was what ultimately changed their minds about defending the regime. Some stayed home to avoid following orders, while others sided with the protesters.

""I didn't join the army to become that kind of man,"" said one.

Another former regime officer expressed shame over the conduct of the military during the uprising. ""You have to understand we were told to make it stop,"" he said. ""These girls were out there every day, provoking us, chanting that they weren't afraid.""

Bashir was deposed by his own generals on April 11 and has since been charged over the deaths of protesters, dozens of whom were killed during the uprising. He is now being held in the maximum-security Kober prison, notorious for holding political prisoners during his 30-year dictatorship.

But the fight is far from over. The military, which dissolved the government after Bashir's removal, has said it will remain in power for up to two years, despite continuing protests against their rule.

""Although Bashir has resigned, the roots of his regime are still in place. The old regime, the old government, the old system of violence, of beating people and provocation, is still in place,"" Rifga Abdelrahman said.

""We want a system that belongs to us,"" she added.

16,WORLD,"Media experts have lauded a restaurant's very public response to an expensive mistake made by one of its staff members.

A diner at the big-budget Hawksmoor restaurant in Manchester, U.K., was accidentally served up an extremely expensive bottle of Chateau le Pin Pomerol 2001. The bottle of wine was worth £4,500 ($5,700) but the customer had ordered one worth a fraction of the price.

The restaurant then tweeted about the incident.

""To the customer who accidentally got given a bottle of Chateau le Pin Pomerol 2001, which is £4,500 on our menu, last night — hope you enjoyed your evening!"" the tweet said. ""To the member of staff who accidentally gave it away, chin up! One-off mistakes happen and we love you anyway.""

The tweet quickly went viral and has been discussed and reported by media outlets all around the world.

The story was helped in no small measure by U.K. broadcaster Piers Morgan, who has more than 6 million followers on his Twitter account.

Morgan asked if he could reserve a table with the same waiter although it should be noted it was the restaurant manager who made the error.

The restaurant's upbeat response to the bad news coupled with the crucial retweet has helped turn an apparent financial loss into something of a marketing coup.

Jennifer Glass, CEO at consultancy Business Growth Strategies told CNBC Friday that the restaurant may have generated ""millions"" in media worth for just £4,500.

""What happened here is another example of creating more visibility for a business,"" she said, adding that the misplaced coffee cup in a recent ""Game of Thrones"" episode may have given Starbucks as much as $2 billion in free advertising.

April Rudin, the founder & CEO at marketing firm The Rudin Group, told CNBC Friday that the restaurant had enjoyed a ""one-two punch when the social media stars had aligned,"" and the firm had leveraged the power of Twitter in real time.

On Twitter, the manager of a rival hotel also congratulated Hawksmoor's deft handling of the situation.

While social media consultant Rob Knowles wondered aloud if the original story might have even been made up.

Whatever the origin, it appears the staff member's job is not at risk. In an interview with The Washington Post, co-owner Will Beckett said that it was the kind of ""expensive mistake"" that he could see himself doing.","A restaurant mistakenly served up a $5,700 bottle of wine.

17,WORLD,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving Venezuela's crisis accelerated on Thursday as the government and opposition sent envoys to talks in Norway, though the two sides' mutual mistrust and differences on key issues could prevent any quick solution.

The Norwegian attempt to mediate, confirmed by opposition officials, comes amid tensions that exploded into street violence when the opposition called in vain for a military uprising on April 30. Details about the initiative, including whether envoys from opposing camps would even negotiate directly, were scarce.

But it coincides with diplomatic efforts elsewhere: Opposition leader Juan Guaidó said in Caracas that he planned to meet a delegation from a mostly European group of nations later Thursday, and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland met Thursday with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez in Havana.

Norway has hosted secret peace talks over the years. They include the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in September 1993, talks between the Philippines government and Maoist rebels in 2011, and the brokering of a 2002 cease-fire between Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebel negotiators. Seven years ago, negotiators from the Colombian government and left-wing FARC rebels held their first direct talks in a decade in Norway.

The Norwegian Centre for Conflict Resolution has worked behind the scenes since last year to bring the two sides in Venezuela together. In October, it sponsored an initiative to bring a Harvard-trained conflict resolution expert to Caracas to foster dialogue. In recent months, with the support of Norway's foreign ministry and diplomats based in Bogota, Colombia, its representatives made several trips to Caracas.

Per Wiggen, an official from Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not confirm planned talks in Oslo, though Norway has urged the two sides to talk since February. Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide told lawmakers on March 5 that Norway could be a mediator.

The representatives in Norway include Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez on the government side and Stalin González, a leading member of the opposition-controlled congress, according to opposition officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the initiative. Without elaborating, Maduro said Rodríguez was on a ""very important"" mission outside Venezuela.

The myriad diplomatic efforts reflect a recognition in Venezuela that neither side has been able to prevail in the struggle for power, leaving the country in a state of political paralysis after years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.

""You don't negotiate because you want to. You negotiate because you have to,"" said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela researcher at the nongovernmental Washington Office on Latin America.

""It's become pretty clear neither has been able to impose their dominant strategy on the other,"" he said.

Ramsey added that the Venezuelan envoys would have to resist pressure from allies who don't want to compromise.

Guaidó confirmed that envoys were in Norway, but warned that the opposition won't enter into any ""false negotiation.""

He said any talks on resolving the Venezuelan crisis must lead to the end of President Nicolás Maduro's government, its replacement by a transitional administration and free and fair elections.

Maduro disputes opposition claims that his reelection last year was illegitimate and says U.S. sanctions imposed on Venezuela to try to oust him should be lifted.

Participation in the mediation effort is a reversal for the opposition, which has accused Maduro of using previous negotiations between 2016 and 2018 to play for time. Maduro, in turn, alleges the opposition tried to seize power by force. U.S. officials have said they are focusing on diplomatic and economic measures to force out Maduro. However, Guaidó said his Washington envoy would meet with the head of the U.S. Southern Command on Monday.

The opposition also says Cuba has propped up Maduro with military and intelligence help. Cuba has denied this. Marcelino Medina, Cuba's First Vice Minister of Foreign Relations, was in Norway on Tuesday and Wednesday as part of what his office called a tour of Scandinavian countries.

Meanwhile, the International Contact Group, comprising eight European nations, the European Union and four Latin American countries, has also been working on the Venezuelan problem. The group formed after Guaidó, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, declared himself interim president in January in a direct challenge to Maduro, who says his government champions the socialist principles of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.

The opposition, backed by more than 50 nations, says Venezuela's dire economic state is the result of years of corruption and mismanagement. Maduro, whose allies include Russia, blames the country's problems on more recent U.S. pressure.

In Washington, four demonstrators who had been protesting inside the Venezuelan Embassy for weeks were arrested Thursday. The protesters consider Maduro to be Venezuela's leader, but the U.S. recognized Guaidó's envoy as ambassador.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza denounced the arrests as a violation of diplomatic immunity and international law.

18,WORLD,"The British ISIS terrorist dubbed Jihadi John was killed by U.S. drone after he was given away by his beard and the way he walked, a new documentary claims.

The terrorist, whose real name was Mohammed Emwazi, became the face of the terror group, appearing in multiple propaganda videos where he beheaded innocent people, including Americans and Britons.

HUNTING AYMAN AL ZAWAHIRI: WHERE HAS THE AL QAEDA LEADER BEEN HIDING FOR 18 YEARS?

A documentary for British TV station Channel 4, which is airing on Monday, reveals that the extremist met his fate when U.S. forces identified him after a drone flew at night over Raqqa, at that point an ISIS stronghold.

Within 15 seconds a missile was launched to wipe out Emwazi. The unsuspecting terrorist was speaking on the phone when the missile hit him, The Sun reported.

Colonel Steve Warren, who was the Pentagon spokesman at the time, told the documentary that because it was dark and they couldn’t see his face, the military identified Emwazi by his beard and the way he walked.

“You can't see his face but we could sort of see how he moved, the cut of his jib, so to speak. The angle of his beard, these things we could see,” he said.

“Eventually we were convinced that this is Jihadi John. And so the floor commander at the time orders, ‘Take the shot.’ Within 15 seconds a missile obliterated Emwazi.”

British intelligence apparatus worked tirelessly to identify Emwazi after he first appeared in an ISIS video back in 2014 with American journalist James Foley who was beheaded off-camera after reading a prepared statement criticizing the U.S.

Emwazi was dubbed ""John"" by a group of hostages, in reference to John Lennon of the Beatles, because the four-man terrorist cell all appeared to have English accents. He was subsequently nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by the media.

Emwazi is understood to have taken extensive measures to avoid being detected, including wiping every computer he used to send messages. But despite his best efforts, British intelligence agency GCHQ quickly established his identity after using voice recognition technology and comparing his voice to the recordings from previous wiretaps taken during a surveillance operation.

The intelligence agencies also looked at the pattern of the veins in his left hand and matched it with an archive picture of him.

The study, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports on Thursday, found that the Australian territory was littered with 238 tonnes of plastic, despite being home to around 500 people, reports CNN.

The group of mostly uninhabited 27 islands -- which are 2,750 km from Perth -- are marketed to tourists as ""Australia's last unspoilt paradise"".



Much of the rubbish was single-use consumer items such as bottle caps, straws, shoes and sandals, University of Tasmania marine eco-toxicologist Jennifer Lavers, who led the study, said.

""Plastic pollution is now ubiquitous in our oceans, and remote islands are an ideal place to get an objective view of the volume of plastic debris now circling the globe,"" Ms Lavers said in a statement.

Jennifer Lavers said that the estimate of 414 million pieces was ""conservative"" as they had only sampled down to a depth of 10 cm, and could not access some beaches that were known as debris ""hotspots"".

In 2017, Ms Lavers revealed research that showed remote Henderson Island in the South Pacific Ocean had the highest density of plastic debris reported anywhere in the world.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands had a lower density of plastic than Henderson Island, but the total volume was higher than Henderson Island's 38 million pieces which weighed 17 tonnes.

• Conrad Black's full pardon came a year after publishing his glowing biography, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.""
• The onetime media baron was convicted of fraud and obstructing justice in a scheme blamed for taking down what was one of the world's biggest newspaper companies.
• Until being bought out, Black partnered with Mr. Trump in building Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago.

The name Conrad Black may not ring a bell for some Americans, but the onetime media baron, society figure and now a recipient of a presidential pardon was in the public spotlight for years. Deported to Canada in 2012 after spending more than three years in prison, Black had been found guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. His long and colorful history includes a long-standing alliance with President Trump.

Born in Canada, Black eventually became a British lord and is described in press accounts as a millionaire who lived like a billionaire. When criticized for allegedly using shareholder money to finance a vacation to Bora Bora and charging an extravagant birthday party for his wife to his company, he reportedly declared that he would ""not re-enact the French Revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility."" He was acquitted of charges related to both incidents.

""A President Like No Other""

In his 20s, Black and longtime business partner David Radler turned an investment in an English-language daily in Quebec into a company that ran more than 300 newspapers. He became a convicted felon decades later when he and other executives were accused of looting about $32 million from Hollinger International, which owned entities including the Chicago Sun-Times, Canada's National Post, the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. Radler pleaded guilty in the scheme blamed for taking down what at the time was among the biggest newspaper companies in the world.

When Black was at the helm, the Sun-Times in the early 2000s sold its building alongside the Chicago River to Mr. Trump, leading to the present-day Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago. The two were partners in the undertaking until Mr. Trump bought out Black.

The full pardon came a day after the National Review published an essay by Black headlined: ""Smooth Sailing Ahead for Trump,"" and a year after the publication of Black's book, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other."" The 74-year-old Black has authored other presidential biographies, including ""Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full,"" in 2007.

""Mr. Black is entirely deserving"" of the pardon, the White House said in a statement. It touted him as having made ""tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought.""",Meet Conrad Black — the convicted felon pardoned by Trump
22,WORLD,"Most of the the wreckage of one of two planes that collided in mid-air while conducting flight seeing tourshas been recovered, and crews in Alaska on Wednesday were working to recover the second. Investigators will put both back together to determine how the crash occurred.

Six people were killed when the float planes, a de Havilland Otter and a de Havilland Beaver, collided near Ketchikan around 12:30 p.m. Monday. Both had passengers from a cruise ship aboard, officials have said. Between the two, 16 people were on board, and 10 survived the collision.

Charles Hanas was among those who helped. He was returning home to Ketchikan on a boat with his wife when he saw ""a float plane just crash straight into the water with a huge splash.""

He said he immediately took the skiff they were towing to help. ""There was heads — people in the water,"" said Hanas, who has lived in Ketchikan for around 40 years.

""They had seen me, and the one lady: 'Help! Help!'"" Hanas said. He took the boat to the woman, who was with a man who was not doing well, Hanas said. That man's head then went under water, Hanas said.

""I reached down and grabbed his hand — and I have handles along my skiff — and I put his hand on there and I says 'hang on to that,' Hanas said.

He helped the woman grab a handle, and then he saw another pair in the water about 10 or 20 yards away to help them. After they grabbed handles, he motored the boat to the beach.

""All I wanted to do was get them out of the water, because it’s cold and they were not swimming very well,” Hanas said. ""I just motored them into the beach, and as soon as they touched, then I knew they weren't going to drown.""

Hanas said went back out and was able to help other survivors. The pilot in the water was also helping people come in, and another woman got to the beach on her own, he said.

National Transportation Safety Board Member Jennifer Homendy said Wednesday that both planes were inbound toward Ketchikan, which is in the far southeastern part of Alaska, when the mid-air collision occurred.

The Taquan Air plane had descended from around 3,800 to 4,000 feet to around 3,300 feet over several miles, something she described as normal, and was traveling at around 145 mph. The Mountain Air plane was flying at about 3,300 feet and at around 122 mph, she said.

The wreckage of the Taquan Air plane, which was submerged in about 75 feet of water about 50 feet from shore, was loaded onto a barge. Crews were working to recover the wreckage of the Mountain Air plane, but the debris field in that crash stretched over 1,000 by 3,000 feet. A portion was in the water, and some debris was on a mountainside, Homendy said Wednesday afternoon.

The cause of the crash is under investigation. The pilot of the Taquan Air plane and passengers were being interviewed Wednesday, Homendy said. A preliminary NTSB report is expected in about two weeks, she said.","Wreckage in deadly Alaska plane crash recovered, as good Samaritan recounts rescues"
23,WORLD,"LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks fell, government bond yields slipped and the Japanese yen firmed on Thursday after the U.S. government hit Chinese telecoms giant Huawei with severe sanctions, further straining Sino-U.S. trade ties.

An index of European shares fell as much as 0.5% in early European trading with the German stock index down 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.4%, pointing to a weak start on Wall Street.

The broad weakness in European markets was somewhat offset by small gains in Chinese and Hong Kong stock indexes leading to only marginal losses on a global stock index as investors expected state authorities to step in to support the market and stabilize sentiment.

""Chinese stocks are up as markets expect authorities to intervene to support sentiment but this kind of activity is not sustainable and unless we see a clear resolution in the China-U.S. trade conflict, overall sentiment will remain weak,"" said Neil Mellor, a senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.

While benchmark indexes in China and Hong Kong were up between 0.3-0.8% at the close of trading, bond markets were signalling more pain for risk appetite.

Core German government bond yields were flirting with their lowest level in nearly three years while Dutch bond yields were about to dip into negative territory, a phenomenon not seen since October 2016.

Late on Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its ""Entity List"" - a move that bans the company from acquiring components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval.

The move took global markets by surprise as sentiment had steadied somewhat in the previous session on news that U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to delay tariffs on auto imports after a swathe of weak U.S. and Chinese economic data.

As trade tensions have made a reappearance on investors' radars, weak U.S. data has also ratcheted up market expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut in the coming months.

In the United States, retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, while industrial production fell 0.5% in April, the third drop this year.

Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds eased to 2.366%, near a 15-month low of 2.340% touched on March 28.

Fed funds rate futures are fully pricing in a rate cut by the end of this year and more than a 50% chance of a move by September.

""The markets are inching step by step in pricing in a rate cut. That is a sea change from a year ago when the consensus was three to four rate hikes a year,"" said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One.

25,WORLD,"In an era of Australian leadership turmoil, the death of Bob Hawke, a beloved former prime minister, feels especially poignant ahead of a national election on Saturday, writes the BBC's Hywel Griffith in Sydney.

Australia loves a larrikin - a rambunctious rogue who does not care about convention. In Bob Hawke, who died on Thursday at 89, the country found a natural leader, happy to play the role.

Though he swore off alcohol while in office, well into his late 80s, he would still perform his famous party-trick of downing a glass of beer at cricket matches, always to rapturous applause.

But Hawke's antics belied a sharp political mind that understood the need to build consensus and keep the voters on his side.

""These acts of drinking, these acts of womanising, as much as they got out into the public eye were a calculated risk on his part,"" says associate Prof Anika Gauja from the University of Sydney.

""It was cultivated on his part to perpetuate his image of an easy-going guy. I'm not sure whether in today's style of politics, whether he'd be seen as too much of a liability in the social media age.""

Hawke's eight years as Australian prime minister - still a record for a Labor leader - stands in conspicuous contrast to the most recent decade of turmoil in Australian politics.

No prime minister has served a full three-year term since another long-serving leader, conservative John Howard, left office in 2007.

For many Australians, both men - though ideological opposites - recall a kind of carefree stability that is lacking in today's politics.

And Hawke still holds the highest approval rating of any serving Australian prime minister.
• What Australia is voting for - in 11 charts
• The vote that spans outback to Antarctica
• Four reasons why Australian politics is so crazy

Despite poor health, he had been active in public consciousness in recent days - releasing spirited statements to promote Labor's cause. Inevitably, his death will loom large in the remaining hours of Australia's election campaign.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison saluted him for having ""a unique ability to speak to all Australians"" and said he would be ""greatly missed"".

Labor leader Bill Shorten - who, like Hawke, forged his career in trade unions - paid tribute to a man he called ""Australia's favourite son"".

Hawke was born in 1929 to a family with strong connections to the Labor movement. By the age of 15 he had told friends he would one day be prime minister.

After studying in Perth, Oxford and Canberra, he entered a career in the trade unions, where he honed his famous negotiating skills.

In 1974, they were called upon to help convince Frank Sinatra to retract sexist comments he had made on tour in Australia, after the singer called female journalists ""buck-and-a-half"" prostitutes.

Sinatra had initially refused to apologise, prompting fury and reports that airport workers would refuse to refuel his plane. It ended in a bizarre standoff at a Sydney hotel.

Over cognac and cigars there, Hawke persuaded Sinatra to issue a statement of regret, ending a nationwide boycott of Sinatra's shows.

Hawke had become a public figure long before he entered parliament at the age of 50, and within three years he rose to become Labor leader and prime minster.

His first, landslide election victory in 1983 gave him a mandate to push through contentious changes, with an agenda of privatisation and deregulation at odds with his party's traditions.

But some of his reforms were clearly too ambitious.

As he set his sights on a third election victory in 1987 he pledged that ""by 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty"".

He would come to regret that defining moment, especially as the written version of his speech said only no child ""need live in poverty.""

It was a rare slip of the tongue for a politician who seemed so comfortable and relaxed on the big stage.

Internationally, he helped renew Australia's floundering friendship with the United States by committing troops to the Gulf War.

But Bob Hawke was also aware of the need to seek allies closer to home.

""His image could be quite perplexing to foreigners, but I think Bob Hawke will be remembered as the Australian prime minister who really started engaging with Asia,"" says Associate Professor Anika Gauja.

""His move to internationalise Australia's economy will be remembered very positively.""

Inevitably his popularity dimmed at home when Australia's economic fortunes worsened, and after eight years in office, in 1991, he was replaced by his long-time Labor colleague and rival Paul Keating.

There was little love lost between the two men, although Bob Hawke did later claim he was grateful to Keating for ousting him from office, as it meant he had the opportunity to re-marry.

In 1995 he divorced his first wife Hazel in order to marry his biographer Blanche d'Alpuget, with whom he had had a long-running extra-marital affair.

Despite losing power, Hawke regularly appeared in public alongside Blanche, his reputation restored and his place in history assured.

Among legacies still felt today, Hawke's government launched Medicare - Australia's universal healthcare system - and outlawed sexual discrimination in the workplace.

It also restricted uranium mining on indigenous lands, and prevented the damming of Tasmania's world heritage-listed Franklin River. Hawke also led international efforts to protect Antarctica from mining, after refusing to ratify a proposal put to Antarctic Treaty nations.

""I just couldn't believe it. Here was the last pristine continent,"" Hawke recalled to the Sydney Morning Herald in 2016. ""We were going to be called upon to ratify it and I thought: 'no bloody way'.""

His death is perhaps felt even more acutely at a time when Australians are preparing to head to the ballot box on Saturday.

As one former Hawke staffer and now ABC presenter, Barrie Cassidy, noted soon after his former boss's death: ""What a sense of timing.""

For most Australians, he will always be remembered as the prime minister who loved a drink and joke, and made the serious work of politics look like fun.",The rambunctious rogue who led Australia

""While the United States is not currently in a position to join the endorsement, we continue to support the overall goals reflected in the call. We will continue to engage governments, industry and civil society to counter terrorist content on the internet,"" the White House said in a statement.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the Christchurch Call earlier Wednesday in Paris at a meeting of digital leaders for the G7 nations, just two months after the March 15 mass shootings on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, left 51 dead and many wounded.

Facebook removed 1.5 million videos of the Christchurch attacks in the first 24 hours after the massacre. It also blocked 1.2 million of them at upload, meaning they would not have been seen by users.

""When it came to the way this attack was specifically designed to be broadcast and to go viral, (responding) to that needed a global solution, so that was why we immediately got in contact with international counterparts,"" Ardern told CNN Tuesday

Facebook has signed on to the agreement , introducing new rules for live-streaming. Under the new policy, the alleged Christchurch shooter would not have been able to livestream the massacre from his account in March, a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business. The US thanked Ardern and Macron ""for organizing this important effort"" in its Wednesday statement, noting that the administration ""(agrees) with the overarching message"" in the nonbinding agreement. The statement condemned terrorist and violent extremist content online ""in the strongest terms,"" however, it cited freedom of expression and freedom of the press as reasons it would not be joining the agreement. ""We encourage technology companies to enforce their terms of service and community standards that forbid the use of their platforms for terrorist purposes. We continue to be proactive in our efforts to counter terrorist content online while also continuing to respect freedom of expression and freedom of the press,"" the statement read. It continued: ""Further, we maintain that the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech, and thus we emphasize the importance of promoting credible, alternative narratives as the primary means by which we can defeat terrorist messaging.""

28,WORLD,"At least six civilians, including women and children, were killed and dozens wounded in Saudi-UAE-led coalition air raids on residential areas and Houthi rebel military targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.

The coalition carried out 11 attacks on the capital in all, out of a total of 19 across rebel-held territory on Thursday, the Houthi-run Masirah TV channel reported. It blamed ""aircraft of the [Saudi-led] aggression"".

The air strikes came two days after the Iran-aligned rebels claimed drone attacks that temporarily shut a key oil pipeline in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.

Rubble filled a populated street lined by mud-brick houses, a Reuters journalist on the scene said. A crowd of men lifted the body of a women, wrapped in a white shroud, into an ambulance.

Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya quoted a coalition statement as saying it launched an operation aimed at ""neutralising the ability of the Houthi militia to carry out acts of aggression"".

""The sorties achieved its goals with full precision,"" it said, adding civilians had been warned to avoid those targets.

Masirah quoted the Houthi health ministry as saying six civilians, including four children, had been killed and 52 wounded, including two Russian women working in the health sector.

Afrah Nasser, a Yemeni journalist, said her family's home in Sanaa was near where one air strike hit. She accused the Saudi-UAE alliance of deliberately targeting civilians.

""I know the street. There are no military targets there. There is no excuse from the Saudi-led coalition - it was a deliberate and systematic bombardment attacking civilians,"" Nasser told Al Jazeera.

Nasser Arrabyee, another Yemeni journalist, said the number of casualties was expected to rise.

""Medical sources are saying that they have received a lot of victims - injured and dead - which means the number will be even higher than just six,"" he told Al Jazeera from Sanaa.

""Residential areas in the middle of Sanaa, in the most crowded areas, were randomly bombed and many houses were reduced to the ground.""

On Tuesday, the Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for twin drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's main East-West oil pipeline, saying they were a response to ""crimes"" committed by Riyadh during the bloody air war it has led in Yemen since March 2015.

Saudi Arabia's deputy defence minister accused Iran on Thursday of ordering the drone attacks on two Aramco pumping stations as a ""tool to implement its expansionist agenda in the region"".

""The terrorist acts, ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis, are tightening the noose around the ongoing political efforts,"" Prince Khalid bin Salman said on Twitter.

The head of the Houthis' Supreme Revolutionary Committee denied that Iran directed the strike and said the movement manufactures its drones locally. Tehran also denies providing arms to the Houthis.

""We are not agents for anyone,"" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said. ""We make decisions independently and do not take orders for drones or anything else.""

The Saudi pipeline, which can carry five million barrels of crude per day, provides a strategic alternative route for Saudi exports if the shipping lane from the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz is closed.

Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the vital conduit for global oil supplies in the case of a military confrontation with the United States.

The Saudi cabinet called on Wednesday for ""confronting terrorist entities which carry out such sabotage acts, including the Iran-backed Houthi militias in Yemen"".

Frederic Pechier, 47, was initially accused in 2017 of poisoning seven patients but French authorities added an additional 17 cases on Thursday.

Nine people have died as a result of the doctor’s alleged poisoning, with Pechier facing a life sentence if convicted.

Pechier worked as an anesthesiologist at two private clinics in the eastern French city of Besancon and the alleged poisonings occurred over the previous 10 years, with some victims as young as four years old, the AFP reported.

He was brought in for questioning this week concerning over 66 more suspicious cardiac arrests during operations. Authorities retained 17 cases of victims, seven of who died after doctors couldn’t revive them.

Public prosecutor Etienne Manteaux said during the televised press conference that the doctor was “the common denominator” in the cases and happened at the time he was clashing with other personnel at a clinic.

31,WORLD,"But Mr. Moon’s government has also feared that South Korea’s conservative opposition would accuse it of coddling the North if it provided a larger aid package, especially with North Korea having resumed short-range missile tests. South Korean conservatives argue that the North has squandered resources on its nuclear arms program that it should have used to help its people.

“This is a time to stop aid if there is any going to the North, not to provide it,” Jun Hee-kyung, a spokeswoman for the conservative Korea Liberty Party, said on Friday after the aid package was announced. She accused Mr. Moon of “irresponsible appeasement.”

The United Nations has imposed a series of tough sanctions on the North over its nuclear program since 2016, banning the export of coal, iron ore and other key North Korean products, as well as sharply cutting oil imports. Those sanctions have deprived the government of important sources of income, as well as undercutting its ability to import food.

North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been hoping to win relief from sanctions in return for partial dismantlement of his country’s nuclear weapons facilities. Mr. Trump refused such an offer in February at his second meeting with Mr. Kim, in Vietnam, demanding that the North relinquish all its nuclear weapons. The talks have since been stymied.

North Korea’s resumption of short-range missile tests last week has been widely seen as a warning that it may return to more ambitious missile launches unless sanctions are eased. Mr. Kim has given Washington until the end of the year to show more flexibility, indicating that his country will otherwise seek an alternative to diplomacy.

The United Nations sanctions do not prohibit humanitarian aid to the North. But as its nuclear and missile work has escalated in recent years, international relief agencies have been unable to collect substantial donations for chronically malnourished children and nursing mothers in the North.

Mr. Moon’s conservative predecessors had sharply curtailed humanitarian aid in response to the North’s nuclear and missile tests. But Mr. Moon, a political liberal, has backed humanitarian aid along with other forms of engagement with the North since taking office in May 2017. His government gave the North $1 million worth of pesticides last year, the South’s first direct governmental aid to the country since 2010.

Mr. Moon’s government also said on Friday that it would let South Korean businesspeople visit the industrial complex in Kaesong, a North Korean border town, that was jointly operated by the Koreas until Mr. Moon’s immediate predecessor shut it down in 2016.

A neo-Nazi who planned to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper in a terrorist attack has been jailed for life.

Jack Renshaw, 23, from Skelmersdale, Lancashire, must serve at least 20 years in prison.

A judge at the Old Bailey said Renshaw, who earlier admitted preparing an act of terror, wanted to ""replicate"" the murder of Jo Cox.

Renshaw made a Nazi salute towards supporters as he was led to the cells from the dock.

He pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to buying a machete to kill the West Lancashire MP and making threats to kill police officer Det Con Victoria Henderson.

A jury twice failed to reach a verdict on charges relating to his membership of banned neo-Nazi group National Action.

Sentencing him for the terror plot, Judge Justice McGowan said Renshaw's ""perverted view of history and current politics"" led him to ""an attempt to damage our entire system of democracy"".

She said: ""You praised the murder of Jo Cox in tweets and posts in June 2017. In some bizarre way you saw this as a commendable act and set out to replicate that behaviour.""

The judge added Renshaw had made ""detailed arrangements"" and studied Ms Cooper's itinerary.

Giving evidence during his first National Action trial last summer, he said he wanted to murder the MP ""to send the state a message"".

He got as far as buying a 19in (48cm) Gladius knife and told members of National Action about his plan during a meeting in a Warrington pub in July 2017.

The plot was foiled by whistleblower and former National Action member, Robbie Mullen, who was secretly passing information to anti-racism charity Hope not Hate, which informed police.
• The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill

Police arrested Renshaw and found the machete hidden in an airing cupboard at his uncle's house.

In a victim impact statement, Ms Cooper said it was ""like something out of a horror movie"".

Friends and family had encouraged her to stand down from Parliament but she refused because ""that would allow tyranny to prevail"".

After the sentencing, Ms Cooper said ""justice has been served"".

Renshaw was also jailed for 16 months in June 2018 for four counts of grooming adolescent boys.

Det Con Henderson, who was investigating the child sex offences, said she ""had sleepless nights"" until he was arrested.

""I am not prepared to let Jack Renshaw ruin my everyday life,"" she said.

The judge praised the two women and told Renshaw: ""You have not defeated them.""

She said he had acted in a polite manner towards Det Con Henderson while planning to kill her in an act of revenge.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it presented evidence that persuaded Renshaw to plead guilty, including online research on cutting the jugular artery and how long it would take someone to die from the wound.

Jenny Hopkins, CPS head of counter terror, said: ""Jack Renshaw was prepared to act on his white supremacist world view and plotted to kill a Member of Parliament - a plan reminiscent of the abhorrent murder of Jo Cox MP.""

34,WORLD,"The Obama administration reportedly agreed to offload three Rwandans accused of slaughtering Americans to Australia -- a previously unknown arrangement connected to a broader migrant swap between the two countries that made headlines when President Trump balked at the deal in 2017.

A lengthy Politico report detailed how the administration agreed to transfer the three Rwandan men accused of a gruesome 1999 attack against Western tourists on a gorilla-watching visit to Uganda. They had been extradited to the U.S. and charged under terrorism laws, but in 2006 a judge ruled that the men’s confessions to the attacks that left two Americans and six other Western tourists dead were extracted through torture by Rwandan officials. The case was dropped and the men were left in limbo until the Obama-era deal.

US TO SEND HOSPITAL SHIP TO HELP WITH VENEZUELAN REFUGEES

The agreement to send them to Australia reportedly was made amid a seemingly related deal, struck during the final days of the Obama administration, for the U.S. to take as many as 1,250 migrants whom Australia was holding in offshore refugee centers -- which had come under international scrutiny for alleged mistreatment of migrants. In return, the U.S. would send over a much smaller number of refugees in Central America as part of an effort to relocate people fleeing drug violence.

President Trump famously raged at then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in January 2017 and tried to renege on the deal, saying it would make him “look terrible” considering he was elected to office on a platform of reducing migration.

“Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground,” he said, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The Washington Post.

Later, when Turnbull pushed back against Trump’s claim that “they are not going to be wonderful people,” Trump quipped, “Well, maybe you should let them out of prison.”

“This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible,” he said. However, he indicated he would not nix the deal.

TRUMP ORDERS ASYLUM OVERHAUL, INCLUDING NEW FEE FOR APPLICANTS AND FASTER ADJUDICATIONS

But amid coverage of that tense conversation, Turnbull may have hinted at the Rwandan prisoner pact, saying cryptically in the leaked transcript: “We are taking people from the previous administration that they were very keen on getting out of the United States.”

That comment has been given new context by the Politico report that highlights the agreement on the Rwandan men. Two of the three men were sent to Australia last year, with no indication they were jailed or detained by authorities there. The remaining man is being held in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Miami, according to the outlet, possibly because the Australians balked at settling him after he attacked a guard.

Politico reports that officials say the deal was not specifically a quid pro quo, but that the Obama administration encouraged Australia to make “a series of gestures on refugee-related issues” in response to the U.S. agreement to take the 1,250 refugees in Australia.

Asked whether the transfer of the Rwandans was explicitly part of the deal, a source told Politico: “The prime minister understood the deal completely. President Trump did not.”

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News that it does not discuss the details of sensitive diplomatic discussions, but that the U.S. continues to honor the arrangement to resettle the refugees. The spokesperson said that so far the U.S. has resettled over 500 refugees.

The revelation is likely to be uncomfortable for current Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who replaced Turnbull last year. It comes just days before a general election in the country.

36,WORLD,"Washington, DC - Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, appeared before a US House of Representatives panel on Thursday to share her love for her fiance and call for a US-sponsored international investigation into his killing.

But US legislators, while sympathetic to her cause, have been unable to offer concrete assurances that the United States will pursue an investigation into the grisly murder.

""All members of Congress that we have spoken with so far tell us about their regrets, but if you are asking for a clear answer, there has been no clear confirmation that there will be an investigation,"" Cengiz told Al Jazeera through a translator after the hearing.

""It has been more than six months since this horrible event, but there has been no truth, justice or accountability for those responsible for this terrible incident, to this stain on human rights and press freedom,"" Cengiz earlier told a House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee on human rights.

In passionate and heart-wrenching testimony, Cengiz described Khashoggi's final moments after the two arrived at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul to pick up marriage papers on October 2, 2018. While Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a Saudi assassination team inside, Cengiz waited outside for her future husband who never emerged.

""As I hoped for good news from him that our marriage papers were in order, as I eagerly awaited the happy surprise of seeing him again, no such things ever happened,"" Cengiz, a Turkish national, said in written testimony.

Saudi officials initially denied Khashoggi's killing at the consulate, saying he had left the premises.

But Turkish authorities released security video showing the arrival and departure of Saudi killers dispatched from Riyadh. Turkish surveillance audio, which was shared with US officials, captured the screaming, choking moments of Khashoggi's death.

Khashoggi and Cengiz met at a conference in May 2018 and began a relationship. Khashoggi, a journalist who wrote critically about politics in Saudi Arabia, had been banned from publishing at home. He fled to the US, was divorced from his Saudi wife as a result, but regained his journalistic voice as a columnist for the Washington Post.

""Jamal was uncomfortable with the changing political atmosphere in his country that began in 2017,"" Cengiz told members of Congress. ""He was disturbed by the uncontrolled exercise of power in Saudi Arabia, its violations of human rights, arbitrary arrests and detentions of scholars and writers, an unprecedented violation to people's basic freedoms.""

'Cannot make sense of this'

Saudi Arabia has acknowledged it was responsible for Khashoggi's killing but has attempted to blame ""rogue"" security agents. The Saudi government announced legal proceedings against a number of individuals involved in the assassination, although those proceedings have not been transparent.

The kingdom has denied any involvement of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. US intelligence assessments concluded the prince ordered Khashoggi's murder. The US Senate has passed a resolution holding him responsible.

US President Donald Trump and members of his administration have declined to assign blame to Crown Prince Mohammed and instead emphasised the importance of the US's strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia in the Middle East.

""I simply cannot make human sense of this,"" Cengiz said, speaking to legislators through a translator. ""I simply cannot understand why the world has done nothing about this.

""In the early days, President Trump said that this would be solved. [House Speaker] Pelosi talked about how unacceptable this was. But so many months later, nothing has been done. That is why I am here,"" she said.

""It wasn't just Jamal that was killed it is also the values that we are talking about here: freedom, of the United States.""

37,WORLD,"An international cybercrime network that tried to steal an estimated $100 million has been taken down in a coordinated multinational effort.

Prosecutors and law enforcement officials from the United States and Europe, speaking at a news conference on Thursday in The Hague, say that criminals used malware to infect tens of thousands of computers worldwide, capturing online banking credentials from unknowing victims in a bid to extract their money.

The scheme took place between October 2015 and December 2016. A virtual assembly line of skills and services by cybercrime specialists made the fraudulent work possible, prosecutors contend.

First, the leader of the group leased access to malware from a developer. Then the developer used coders to create GozNym, a hybrid of two malware strains called Gozi and Nymaim.

Suspects advertised their skills online in an underground Russian-language forum, where they were allegedly recruited by Alexander Konovolov, a 35-year-old Georgian who ultimately controlled more than 41,000 computers.

To ward off detection, distribute the malware, take over bank accounts and cash out, there were ""bulletproof hosters, money mules networks, crypters, spammers, coders, organizers, and technical support,"" said Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency.

William Carter, deputy director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR that cybercrime as a service industry is becoming more common — that people can pay for phishing, botnets and other services.

""Really at this point it doesn't take a lot of audacity,"" he says. ""The chances that [law enforcement] will track down all the little service providers are pretty small. And the payoff can be pretty large.""

Carter says there are enough people and businesses in the world not following basic cybersecurity practices that a criminal can use unsophisticated tools to make money by hitting many targets quickly.

With GozNym, victims received phishing emails that looked legitimate but contained a malicious link or attachment that led the malware to be downloaded on their computers.

The victims included a church in Texas, a casino in Mississippi and an association that provides services to people with disabilities in Illinois. A number of U.S. businesses and their financial institutions fell victim to GozNym, especially in Western Pennsylvania, where federal investigators and prosecutors later conducted an operation.

In an indictment unsealed Thursday, 10 alleged members of the criminal network were accused of using GozNym to capture online banking credentials from victims, before using that information to pilfer money from bank accounts and launder the funds with U.S. and foreign bank accounts.

The network members were charged with conspiracies to commit computer fraud, wire and bank fraud as well as money laundering. An 11th member was charged in a previous indictment.

Five Russians accused of being involved in the scheme reside in Russia as ""fugitives from justice,"" according to the Department of Justice. The FBI asked the public to help locate them Thursday. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania issued a federal arrest warrant for them in April.

Other members of the criminal network live in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, according to prosecutors. That led to an ""unprecedented"" push for cooperation — sharing of evidence, arrests and extraditions — between the United States, those countries and Germany.

Criminal prosecutions are underway in Georgia and Moldova. In Ukraine, law enforcement arrested Gennady Kapkanov, 36, for allegedly shooting an assault rifle through his apartment door during a police raid that targeted network servers. He is being prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the GozNym network.

U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said that the only way to stem transnational criminal networks is through partnership. ""The collaborative and simultaneous prosecution of the members of the GozNym criminal conspiracy in four countries represents a paradigm shift in how we investigate and prosecute cybercrime,"" Brady said.",Authorities Dismantle Transnational Cybercrime Group

Indonesian police said Friday that they have arrested Islamic-State linked terror suspects, including some who planned to detonate bombs at political demonstrations when election results are announced next week.

Police said militants wanted to take advantage of any political unrest to spark chaos by using use WiFi to remotely detonate bomb-filled backpacks at crowded demonstrations.

'So we're urging the public not to go out on the streets on May 22 because it could be dangerous as they (the suspects) wanted to attack crowds and police officers,' a police spokesman told reporters in the capital Jakarta.

Some 29 suspects were rounded up this month alone, with 60 in all detained since the start of the year in raids across the Southeast Asian nation, they said.

Eight other suspects had been killed in confrontations with authorities, police said, including the wife of a militant who blew up herself and a child following a dramatic standoff at their home in March.

Some arrested suspects were skilled bomb makers and had fought alongside the jihadist group in Syria, as well as members of local extremist network Jemaah Anshurat Daulah (JAD), police said.

JAD has pledged allegiance to IS and was blamed for a wave of suicide bombings at churches in Indonesia's second-biggest city Surabaya last year.

The world's biggest Muslim majority nation has seen a string of attacks by Islamist militants since the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed more than 200 people, including scores of tourists.

National police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal on Friday described the latest arrests as a 'preventative strike' before the official announcement of Indonesian elections, which were held on April 17.

There are concerns about street demonstrations after presidential challenger Prabowo Subianto, a retired military general, warned that protests could erupt over his claims of massive electoral fraud.

Subianto has vowed not to recognise next week's results if they hand a re-election victory to president Joko Widodo, who has a lead of about 12 percentage points, according to unofficial polls.

The defendants come from six nations and several are awaiting prosecution in Europe. An 11th defendant in a related case was extradited to the U.S. from Bulgaria in 2016 and pleaded guilty last month in federal court in Pittsburgh, where Thursday's case was brought.

The charges include conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Though the Justice Department has pursued multiple malware prosecutions in recent years against foreign hackers, this case stands out as a model of international collaboration, said Scott Brady, the United States attorney in Pittsburgh.

Instead of seeking the immediate extradition of all 10 defendants — an often cumbersome process that can take years of negotiations, even in countries that have treaties with the U.S. — prosecutors will first bring charges against several of them in the East European countries of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.

""It represents a paradigm change in how we prosecute cybercrime,"" Brady said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of a news conference in The Hague with representatives of the six countries.

The investigation was an outgrowth of the Justice Department's dismantling in 2016 of a network of computer servers, known as Avalanche, which hosted more than two dozen different types of malware.

""For the past three years, we have been unpeeling an onion as it were that is very challenging to investigate and identify,"" Brady said.

The malware cited in the current court case infected 41,000 computers, relying on spam emails that were disguised as legitimate messages or invoices, officials said. Once opened, the emails enabled hackers operating from Europe to record the keystrokes from the victims' computers, steal banking log-in credentials and wire money away from accounts.

Brady said that while prosecutors always look to recover stolen funds, that effort is especially challenging in international cybercrime cases.

""Proceeds were converted to bitcoin and without the private key, it is really hard to identify and access, let alone seize, those accounts,"" Brady said.","Cybercriminals behind $100 million malware attacks, U.S. and Europe claim"
41,WORLD,"German authorities say they have charged two men for allegedly being involved in sexually abusing children at a campsite for years.

Detmold prosecutors said Friday that a 56-year-old suspect identified only as AV was charged with nearly 300 offenses, including 226 counts of sexually assaulting 10 different children.

Prosecutors say the assaults took place in the summer of 1998 and from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2018 at the campsite in Luegde, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Berlin. The indictment identifies 22 victims overall.

42,WORLD,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday terminated Turkey’s preferential trade treatment that allowed some exports to enter the country duty free, but it has halved its tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 25%.

The White House said it was appropriate to terminate Turkey’s eligibility to participate in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, based on its level of economic development. The decision is effective May 17, it added.

The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) in early March said Turkey was no longer eligible to participate because it “is sufficiently economically developed.” It had begun reviewing the NATO ally’s status in the program last August when the two countries were embroiled in a diplomatic row.

But Ankara had been hopeful that Washington would not go ahead with the decision, saying it would be against the $75 billion target for mutual trade laid out by President Donald Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.

During last year’s spat, Trump had imposed higher tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and aluminum to put economic pressure on NATO member Turkey to force it to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor who was detained there over terrorism charges. Brunson was released last October.

Trump’s move had sent the Turkish lira into a tailspin. Since then, the ties between the two countries have remained tense over disagreements ranging from Ankara’s planned purchase of a Russian missile system to diverging interests in Syria.

In a subsequent statement on Thursday, the White House said it was reducing the 50% tariff, doubled last August, to 25%. “Maintaining the existing 25% tariff on most countries is necessary and appropriate at this time to address the threatened impairment of the national security,” it said.

Turkey was one of 120 countries that participate in the GSP, the oldest and largest U.S. trade preference program. It aims to promote economic development in beneficiary countries and territories by eliminating duties on thousands of products.

The United States imported $1.66 billion in 2017 from Turkey under the GSP program, representing 17.7 percent of total U.S. imports from Turkey, according to USTR’s website.

The leading GSP import categories were vehicles and vehicle parts, jewelry and precious metals, and stone articles, the website said.","terminates Turkey's preferential trade agreement, reduces..."
43,WORLD,"For all the heated talk coming from Washington about President Nicolás Maduro being a Cuban puppet, there was a time when Cuban troops really did try to take control of Venezuela — or at least a remote coconut-strewn tropical beach.

Fifty-two years ago this month an expeditionary force of 12 guerrillas departed from the communist-run island and days later landed in this sleepy fishing village with the goal of spreading Fidel Castro's revolution to South America.

The incursion — condemned at the time as a Cuban ""invasion"" — was a resounding failure. Of the four Cuban guerrillas transporting the mission, one drowned when their inflatable raft overturned while the others were captured by a military patrol tipped off about the landing by a CIA mole. Within a year, the insurgency, which included eight Venezuelans who evaded capture, was wiped out.

Fast-forward a half century and Venezuela's socialist government would welcome what past governments condemned as ""invaders"" with a red carpet — a fact not lost on the U.S., which has accused Cuba of being Maduro's main prop in power as the economy around him falls apart.

""No one has done more to support the corrupt Maduro regime than Cuba,"" Vice President Mike Pence said in a policy speech this month. ""The people of Venezuela are essentially Cuba's hostage.""

But the reality of Cuban influence in Venezuela is more nuanced.

The extraordinarily tight alliance between the two countries was forged when Castro counseled Hugo Chávez following a failed 2002 coup. Venezuela has since sent an estimated $30 billion worth of oil to Cuba in exchange for Havana dispatching tens of thousands of medical workers and other government employees, including intelligence and military advisers, according to defectors.

While nobody doubts the strong ideological alliance, U.S. estimates of as many as 25,000 Cuban troops on the ground have been denied by Cuba and seem wildly exaggerated even to some in the U.S. intelligence community.

""There are no troops,"" Carlos Fernández de Cossío, Cuba's director general of U.S. affairs, said in a recent interview in Washington. ""Cuba does not participate in military operations nor in security operations in Venezuela.""

What's not in doubt is Cuba's strategic interest in Venezuela — something that traces its roots to the Machurucuto (pronounced ma.tju.?u.KU.to) incident.

A straggling visitor to the depressed town of 500 would never know from the boarded-up beach kiosks and decaying fishing boats that it was briefly a flashpoint in the Cold War fight against communism.

It was chosen as a beachhead because of its proximity to a jungled mountain range stretching toward Caracas that was a major center of guerrilla activity.

Ana Morffe, one of the few elderly residents who remember the incident, said she didn't even know what a guerrilla was at the time. But unbeknownst to her, one of the young fighters sneaked through an open window of her house while she was out washing clothes at the river and cooked himself a meal.

""I didn't see him, but he surely saw me,"" said the 75-year-old.

Héctor Pérez Marcano, one of the surviving members of the expedition, said Castro's support stemmed from an overriding interest in Venezuela's oil.

A little more than two weeks after Castro rode into Havana triumphantly in 1959, he flew to Caracas, where massive crowds lined highways to get a glimpse of the bearded revolutionary whose defeat of the U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista would inspire a new generation of Latin American leftists.

A few years later, Marcano and a few dozen Venezuelans traveled to Cuba for military training. He said the idea of deploying by sea came directly from Castro at a meeting on the top floor of the Habana Libre hotel during the first Tricontinental Conference of revolutionaries from Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Almost 18 months later, Castro was present when the rebels shipped out from Santiago de Cuba at 6 a.m., handing each member of the expedition a Rolex watch — the ultimate all-terrain aid for any revolutionary worth his salt, he told them. A year earlier, another landing squad with 15 Cuban guerrillas, including a highly-decorated war hero who would go on to command Castro's troops in Ethiopia and Angola, landed covertly in western Falcon state.

""Back then (for Fidel) Venezuela was the crown jewel of Latin America,"" said Marcano.

The impact of the clandestine intervention was immediately felt: an emergency meeting of regional diplomats was convened in Washington and Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Havana. It would take seven years for them to be restored.

Marcano, an opponent of Maduro, said Venezuela's petro-diplomacy over the past decade has been at the service of Cuba's interests.

""What Fidel was unable to accomplish in the 1960s through armed conflict he was able to do now using Chavez and Venezuela as a tool for hemispheric domination,"" said Marcano.

William Izarra was a recent graduate of Venezuela's air force academy when he was sent to Machurucuto and asked to interrogate one of the Cuban subversives, Antonio Briones, in a field tent set up on the beach.

Trained under the influence of U.S. national security doctrine to despise communists, he was instead amazed by the firmness of Briones' revolutionary ideals, which contrasted with his soft green eyes and serene demeanor.

""I thought a communist was someone with horns and a tail,"" said Izarra, who is now a member of Venezuela's ruling socialist party and teaches course on Marxism. ""But it turned out the devil was actually an angel.""

When he showed up the next day, Briones was lying dead on the beach, his face ripped off. How he was killed remains a mystery.

But Izarra credits the brief encounter with the Cuban rebel for a political epiphany. Over the ensuing two decades, he'd work clandestinely to spread leftist ideology inside the barracks, eventually joining forces with coup-plotters led by then-Lieutenant Chávez.

He disputes Marcano's view that Cuba is pulling Maduro's strings, and worries that as Venezuela's political crisis attracts more international attention the U.S. is magnifying the role played by Cuba in something akin to the Cold War hysteria.

""There's a real push to return to anti-communist ideology in which Cuba is identified as the source of all evil,"" he said.

In Machurucuto, opinions about the Cubans vary. A plaque dedicated by Izarra and other government supporters in 2006 has since been stolen. Chavez, despite an almost encyclopedic knowledge and passion for history, never visited the town as president, reflecting some of the nationalist sensibilities that compete for support of socialism inside the ruling party.

Cuba's government has been far more generous. There's a town in western Cuba named for Briones, as well as a military medal emblazoned with his image.

Meanwhile, for many town residents, their only contact with the one-time aggressors is at a hospital in a nearby city where Cuban doctors treat them for free — albeit with alarmingly scant medical supplies.

Morffe, despite surviving on a pension that's barely enough to afford a kilo of meat, still supports Maduro, blaming instead the people he's surrounded himself with for the country's sorry state. She said Venezuelans need to learn from Cuba, which suffered severely following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of generous subsidies, as it struggles to confront its own hardships.

""They talk to you, they're our friends,"" said Morffe of the Cuban doctors. ""The little we have is because of them.""","Decades after failed invasion, Cuba still eyes Venezuela"

46,WORLD,"A Mexican journalist enrolled in a federal protection programme has been shot dead, the fifth reporter to be killed this year in one of the most dangerous countries for the press.

The blood-soaked body of crime reporter Francisco Romero was found on a pavement outside a nightclub in his hometown of Playa del Carmen along Mexico's Caribbean coast on Thursday, authorities said.

Romero ran a Facebook-based news site called ""Ocurrio Aqui"" (It Happened Here) that covers local politics and crime and had more than 17,000 followers. He also worked for one of the state's leading newspapers, Quintana Roo Hoy.

The state prosecutor's office opened a homicide investigation, saying Romero had filed a complaint on April 12 over threats he had received. The source of those threats was not specified.

Romero's wife Veronica Rodriguez said he had regularly received threats over his work, which sometimes rubbed local government officials the wrong way.

""He had received a lot of threats. Too many threats. The authorities in Mexico City knew about them,"" Rodriguez, 40, told AFP news agency.

""The last time wasn't even two weeks ago. They threatened him, saying that if he didn't do what they wanted, they were going to kill him ... They said they knew where our son studied, that they were going to throw him off a bridge,"" she said.

Reporters Without Borders said Romero received a phone call at 5am on Thursday, informing him about some incident at a local nightclub called the Gotta Gentleman Club.

Although he had four bodyguards, provided by the government, he had sent them home at 10pm the night before, it said in a statement.

Romero, who also had a panic button to alert the authorities if his life was in danger, went without them to the club. His body was found an hour later.

Witnesses said he was beaten and shot twice in the face, the organisation said.

Romero was under an official protection programme for journalists since 2018, according to Balbina Flores, Mexico director for Reporters Without Borders.

The government programme provides different kinds of security to under threat journalists and human rights activists, ranging from panic buttons to home surveillance to bodyguards.

Reporters Without Borders said the killing officially made Mexico the deadliest country in the world for journalists so far this year.

Five journalists have been killed in the country in 2019. Across Mexico, more than 100 have been murdered since 2000. The vast majority of those killings remain unpunished.

48,WORLD,"Brazil's federal prosecutor's office said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit seeking the immediate suspension of a decree by President Jair Bolsonaro loosening regulations on guns and ammunition.

The lawsuit argues that the president infringed on legislative territory, saying the decree conflicts with current laws and also ""jeopardizes the public safety of all Brazilians.""

Co-signed by five federal prosecutors, the suit says the increase in sales of firearms to be expected under the decree would have a lasting impact on the amount of weapons circulating in the country.

""The measure has an immediate impact on the criminal sphere,"" read the suit that was filed Tuesday with a federal court in Brasilia, the capital.

Bolsonaro ordered the reversal of limitations on who can acquire a firearm and of strict supervision procedures. Under the decree, shooting instructors, gun collectors, hunters, tax collectors, bus and truck drivers, elected officials, lawyers, rural residents, private security guards and even journalists on assignment with police can acquire guns without authorization from the federal police.

The decree also increases the amount of ammunition gun owners can buy, from 50 rounds a year to between 1,000 and 5,000 rounds, depending on their licenses.

Prosecutors specifically criticized the loosening of regulations for people living in rural areas. According to the Brazilian think tank Igarape, some 18.6 million ""rural residents"" could acquire firearms more easily.

Bolsonaro has close ties with the ""rural"" caucus. The president, a far-right former army captain, ran a tough-on-crime presidential campaign last year, vowing to allow Brazilians to protect themselves against criminals in the nation that leads the world in total annual homicides. ""The life of a good citizen has no price,"" Bolsonaro said at the recent opening of a public security intelligence center in the state of Parana.

The decree issued last week has drawn criticism from prosecutors and some politicians.

On May 8, the Sustainability Network party filed a petition with the Supreme Federal Tribunal, arguing that the decree is unconstitutional because it makes changes in law that require approval by Congress. Supreme court Justice Rosa Weber asked Bolsonaro and Brazil's justice minister to provide more information on the decree before she could rule on the case.

49,WORLD,"Ottawa (CNN) The Philippines has recalled its ambassador to Canada in an escalating row after Ottawa missed a deadline and failed to reclaim garbage shipped to Manila about six years ago, the country's presidential spokesperson said.

More than 100 containers filled with household waste believed to be recyclable plastic arrived in the Port of Manila between 2013-2014; it was actually nonrecyclable plastic, household waste, and diapers, the Philipines News Agency reported.

Private Canadian company Chronic Inc. and its Philippine-based consignees transported 103 container vans of waste from Canada to the Philippines, according to the legal non-profit Pacific Centre for Environmental Law and Litigation (CELL).

In an April assessment, CELL said that Canada had violated the Basel Convention -- an international treaty designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations -- during those years.

""The container vans were falsely declared to contain homogenous plastic scrap material when in fact these shipments contained heterogenous waste including baled household garbage,"" CELL said.

CNN was unable to immediately make contact with the company.

Speaking from Paris on Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the government had been working ""very closely"" with Philippine officials on the issue over the past months, adding that ""we very much hope to get to a resolution shortly.""

Philippine presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo was due to meet Canadian authorities to discuss the issue of waste, but he claims that they did not show up, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency.

""The more they delay, the more personnel will be coming back,"" Panelo said, adding that ""the refusal to bring the garbage back to their shores is disruptive of our diplomatic relations.""

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin Jr. tweeted that the Philippines will ""maintain a diminished diplomatic presence in Canada until its garbage is ship bound there.""

Global Affairs Canada, which manages the country's diplomatic relations, released a statement saying it is committed to promptly shipping the Canadian waste from the Philippines.

50,WORLD,"Sudan's pro-democracy protesters said on Thursday the ruling military council's suspension of talks was a ""regrettable"" setback to efforts to forge a new democratic era following the overthrow of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir.

The Transitional Military Council (TMC) and protest leaders had been expected to come to an agreement on Wednesday over the make-up of a new body to govern Sudan for three years.

But in the early hours of Thursday, the chief of Sudan's ruling military council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced the talks had been suspended for 72 hours as the security in the capital had deteriorated.

The Alliance for Freedom and Change, the group that is leading the protest movement and negotiating the transfer of power with the army rulers, said the move was ""regretable"".

 

""It ignores the developments achieved in negotiations so far... and the fact that Wednesday's meeting was to finalise the agreement, which would have stopped the escalations such as roadblocks.""

The protest movement vowed to press on with the ""sit-in outside the army headquarters and across the country"".

At least 14 people were wounded, some from gunfire, when security forces tried to remove demonstrators from central Khartoum, according to a group linked to the protest movement.

Both the military and the opposition blamed each other for Wednesday's violence.

""We hold the military council responsible for attacking civilians,"" said Amjad Farid, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which spearheaded months of protests that led to the military's removal of President Omar al-Bashir last month.

""They are using the same methods as the previous regime in dealing with rebels,"" he told Reuters news agency.

But al-Burhan accused the demonstrators of breaking an understanding on the de-escalation process while talks were under way and said protesters were disrupting life in the capital by blocking roads outside a protest zone agreed upon with the military.

He said bridges, roads and a railway line had been closed and there was an ""infiltration of armed elements among demonstrators who were shooting at security forces"".

On Thursday morning, several roadblocks in downtown Khartoum had been taken down with troops from the Rapid Support Froces (RSF) deployed in some areas, according to AFP news agency.

 

Roadblocks on key thoroughfares in the capital are being used by demonstrators to pressure the generals to transfer power to a civilian administration.

The developments came hours after protesters said troops in military vehicles using the logo of the RSF fired extensively as they tried to clear demonstrators on al-Mek Nimir Avenue in central Khartoum, near the foreign ministry.

""People were walking towards the barricades and they (security forces) were firing shots at them,"" a 20-year-old demonstrator, who asked not to be named, told Reuters news agency, showing a handful of empty bullet casings and referring to roadblocks set up by protesters.

The violence took place hours before the TMC was due to meet representatives of the umbrella opposition group Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) to try to hammer out the final deal for the transition period.

Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, called the suspension of the talks a ""very significant development"" that showed ""the level of tension between the two sides"".

""Looking ahead, there is a lot of tension and many challenges between the two sides in trying to form a transitional government.""

The violence came after the TMC announced earlier on Wednesday that after two days of talks it had brokered a deal with the DFCF alliance on the composition of a legislative council and a three-year transition period to a civilian administration.

Under the agreement the opposition alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council, the TMC announced.

However, the two sides have yet to agree on the make-up of a sovereign council, the envisaged top tier of power during the planned transition period, with both wanting majority representation.

Amid the back-and-forth discussions, protesters pushing for a civilian-led transition have remained on the streets, including outside the army headquarters where a sit-in started on April 6.

Some roads in the centre of the capital have been blocked with stones, bricks, branches and slabs of concrete that security and paramilitary forces have occasionally tried to remove.

On Monday, after security forces opened fire while trying to clear some protest sites, an outburst of violence left at least four people dead, including three protesters and a military police officer. They were the first deaths linked to the protests for several weeks.

Al Jazeera's Morgan said the TMC denied responsibility for the violence.

""The military council came out and said the people who fired at protesters were not part of their forces or from the RSF,"" she said, adding that the TMC said it would launch an independent investigation into the incident.

The United States blamed Sudan's military rulers for the deaths, however.

""The tragic attacks on protesters ... were clearly the result of the Transitional Military Council trying to impose its will on the protesters by attempting to remove roadblocks,"" the US Embassy in Khartoum said in a statement on Facebook.

""The decision for security forces to escalate the use of force, including the unnecessary use of tear gas, led directly to the unacceptable violence later in the day that the TMC was unable to control.""

Separately on Monday, Sudan's prosecutor general announced that al-Bashir had been charged ""with inciting and participating"" in the killing of protesters during the mass protests that led to the end of his decades-long rule.

There has been no comment from al-Bashir since his removal and arrest on April 11. The former president is reportedly being held at the maximum security Kobar prison in Khartoum.

Demonstrations against the 75-year-old were sparked by a government decision in December to slash bread and fuel subsidies but quickly escalated into wider calls for him to stand down.

Human Rights Watch, citing monitoring groups, said last month at least 70 protesters have been killed by government forces since the demonstrations began.

51,WORLD,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a recent interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung that she thinks the postwar global order built over seven decades is over — and grouped the United States with China and Russia as rivals of Europe.

Merkel, who's been Germany's chancellor since 2005 and was the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party from 2000 to 2018, said in the interview, which was shared with The Guardian, that the traditionally strong diplomatic and military alliance between the European Union and the United States forged after World War II is now on shaky footing.

""There is no doubt that Europe needs to reposition itself in a changed world,"" Merkel said. ""The old certainties of the postwar order no longer apply.""

According to The Guardian, she added that the US, Russia, and China ""are forcing us, time and again, to find common positions.""

Merkel said she thinks the rise of right-wing populism — which many scholars have cited as the force behind seismic geopolitical events like Britain's exit from the EU, the election of US President Donald Trump, and the rise of populist leaders throughout Europe — has fundamentally shifted the global order of alliances and leaves Europe and its political and economic union on the defense.

""Simply stating that we've enjoyed seven decades of peace is no longer enough to justify the European project,"" she said. ""Without forward-looking arguments to justify Europe, the European peace project would also be in greater jeopardy than one may think.""

Less than three years ago, Germany was one of the US's closest allies, and Merkel was working harmoniously with President Barack Obama. Merkel and Obama not only shared perspectives on various foreign and economic policy issues but were close friends.

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused Merkel of ""ruining Germany"" by allowing Syrian refugees to resettle there, and he tried to smear his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, by comparing her to Merkel.

And over the past year and a half, Trump has consistently criticized Germany over trade and accused it of not contributing fairly to NATO's budget, leading to several tense interactions between him and Merkel, who has publicly decried Trump's cozy relationship with Russia.

52,WORLD,"Over the past five months, as Beijing and Washington have exchanged fire on trade and technology, two Canadian men have been held in near-isolation in Chinese detention facilities.

On Thursday, 158 days into their ordeal, they were formally arrested, a legal step that confirms that China intends to move forward with cases against them — and that hints at the political factors at play.

Former diplomat Michael Kovrig was arrested on charges of “gathering state secrets and intelligence for overseas forces” and entrepreneur Michael Spavor on charges of “stealing and providing state secrets to overseas forces,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Spokesman Lu Kang said the men were arrested “recently” but would not specify when.

The news broke as the world’s two economic superpowers clashed on the issues that frame the case: technology and trade.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested days after Meng Wangzhou, chief financial officer for China’s Huawei Technologies, was arrested in Vancouver, B.C., on U.S. charges — and they remain caught in a broader battle between China and the United States.

Last week, trade talks between the United States and China appeared to collapse, leading both countries to levy additional tariffs on each other. On Wednesday, the U.S. government all but banned American companies from doing business with Huawei.

Against this backdrop, the formal arrest will almost certainly be interpreted as a political signal, said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University. “The message is: ‘We are still mad about Meng and Huawei, and we are going to continue with our charges. We are not backing away from this,’ ” he said.

[Canada arrested Huawei’s Meng for the United States. As China retaliates, it’s on its own.]

In the short term, tough talk from Beijing and Washington will do little to help Canada, which has been caught in the middle of the U.S.-China showdown for months.

Spavor, a businessman based near the China-North Korea border, and Kovrig, who conducts geopolitics research, were first detained by Chinese state security on Dec. 10, a week after Canadian airport authorities arrested Meng at the behest of U.S. law enforcement.

The Huawei executive has since been undergoing extradition proceedings in a Canadian court, which is deciding whether to send her to the United States to face bank-fraud charges tied to alleged violations of sanctions against Iran.

A Canadian judge this month allowed Meng to move from a $4.2 million mansion into a bigger, $10 million mansion for security reasons. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, owns several homes in Canada.

Meng’s attorneys have argued that her constitutional rights were violated when she was interrogated for three hours at Vancouver’s airport and that she should be released.

China casts her case as an effort to constrain the country. It has repeatedly issued implicit warnings that Canada will pay a steep price if Meng is handed over. Chinese officials also stopped some shipments of canola, a critical Canadian export, raising worries of economic retaliation to come.

Weeks after Meng’s arrest, China revisited a 15-year prison term for Canadian Robert L. Schellenberg in a drug-trafficking case and sentenced him to death.

Last week, a Chinese court scheduled Schellenberg’s appeal hearing to begin hours after Meng faced an extradition hearing in Vancouver. After a Canadian court pushed back a decision in Meng’s case, the Chinese court announced it would delay a ruling on whether Schellenberg would be put to death.

It is not clear what the latest legal step means for Kovrig’s and Spavor’s future.

Canadian officials have stressed from the start that Meng’s arrest was a legal decision, not a political one, but a tweet from President Trump undermined their claim.

In December, Trump tweeted that he would intervene in the Meng case to get a better trade deal with China. Though U.S. officials have since backed away from the offer, the notion that Meng’s case is politically motivated has lingered.

With the Meng case and the Kovrig and Spavor cases heading toward what could be lengthy legal proceedings, a deal looks less likely, at least for now.

“I think formal arrests suggest China has made up its mind that it wants to get tough with Canada over at least the medium term,” said Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto.

But, she added, “it is still possible to negotiate for their release.”

The formal start of proceedings against Kovrig and Spavor could lead to changes in conditions on the ground, though there are no guarantees.

Since December, both men have been kept in cells at undisclosed locations with lights on round-the-clock and without access to lawyers or family members, people familiar with the matter say.

The two have been allowed short consular visits once a month, during which they are not permitted to discuss the cases against them with Canadian diplomats.

Ku said conditions could improve, at least marginally. “It’s not great to be in the official legal system, but it’s much worse to be where they were before,” he said.",What ‘arrest’ means for the Canadians detained in China — and the epic battle over Huawei
53,WORLD,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The same week U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping increases on tariffs against Chinese goods, Chinese buyers dropped orders for 3,247 metric tonnes of U.S. pork - the biggest cancellation in more than a year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data released on Thursday.

The cancellation came during the week ended May 9, a blow to the $6.5 billion export market for American pork, vital to the burgeoning U.S. meat industry.

Prior to the trade war, China and Hong Kong combined were the second largest export market for U.S. pork.

For months, the U.S. farm sector - which has been among the hardest hit by the trade war between the world’s two largest economies - has been banking on China increasing its U.S. pork purchases due to African swine fever (ASF).

But the trade war, and China’s tariffs against U.S. pork, is showing signs of slowing China’s willingness to load up on the meat, say industry analysts.

Earlier this year, China canceled sales of 53 metric tonnes in the week ended Feb. 28, sales of 999 metric tonnes in the week ended March 21, and 214 metric tonnes in the week ended April 18, according to USDA data.

Market analysts said the cancellation news on Thursday weighed on the lean hog futures market.

“It’s just disappointing that this trade war could drag on for months and that means more tariffs on pork,” said Dennis Smith, commodity broker with Archer Financial Services. “This should not be happening. We should be selling a lot of pork to China, because of ASF.”

African swine fever kills almost all pigs infected, though it is not harmful to people. The disease has spread rapidly across China, the world’s top pork producer. In neighboring Vietnam the government said it will mobilize its military and police forces to combat an outbreak.

USDA said on Thursday that it will soon begin testing sick and dead pigs for the hog virus that has killed herds across Asia in an effort to minimize devastation if the disease enters the United States.",China cancels pork import order as -China trade war drags on
54,WORLD,"Delphine Boel, a Belgian artist and sculptor, claims the king had an affair with her mother, Sibylle de Selys Longchamps, resulting in her birth in 1968.

Albert married Paola Ruffo di Calabria, later Queen Paola of Belgium, in 1959. He became king in 1993.

In 2013, at the age of 79, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son Philippe, citing concerns over his age and health.

That same year, Boel launched a legal case to see the former king recognized as her father.

In October of 2018, the Brussels Court of Appeal ruled in her favor and ordered Albert to submit to a DNA test, but so far he has not done so. Belgium's King Albert II gives up throne to son Albert must now submit to a test by a court-appointed forensic expert or face a fine, the appeals court ruled Thursday. At Boel's request, the result of the DNA test will be kept confidential until the legal proceedings conclude.

""I can't imagine for a second that he doesn't submit to the test,"" Uyttendaele said.

55,WORLD,"House Democrats are considering bringing up portions of their For The People Act, better known as H.R. 1, for a vote in an attempt to strong arm the Republican-controlled Senate into taking up individual electoral reform bills, Politico reported Thursday.

The sweeping anti-corruption reform bill — which includes provisions to enable automatic voter registration, strengthen resources to stave off foreign threats on elections and make Election Day a national holiday for federal workers — passed the lower chamber along party lines in March.

But Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellReport: House Dems considering bringing part of HR 1 to the floor Overnight Defense: Congressional leaders receive classified briefing on Iran | Trump on war: 'I hope not' | Key Republican calls threats credible | Warren plan targets corporate influence at Pentagon Senate confirms Trump judge who faced scrutiny over abortion views MORE (R-Ky.), who dubbed the bill the Democrat Politician Protection Act, blasted the measure as a power grab that failed to address voter fraud and argued allegations of a voting crisis in the U.S. are a fallacy.

Proponents of the piecemeal strategy feel it would allow Democrats to shine a spotlight on their top legislative priority and cast blame on Senate Republicans for gridlock in Washington ahead of the 2020 election cycle.

Proponents of the bill say the enactment of the package is critical if Congress is going to restore voter trust in lawmakers working in their best interest.

But language advocating for D.C. statehood, a prohibition on gerrymandering a provision allowing federal workers to take up to six days of paid leave to work at polls and the creation of a 6-to-1 federal campaign match on small donations received strong pushback from Republicans.

Moderate Republicans previously expressed openness to certain provisions — including its language to improve election security and to protect our elections from foreign interference — that were in the of the House-passed measure which could amp up pressure in the Senate.

While it remains unclear what will ultimately be brought to the floor, Democrats face an uphill battle in swaying McConnell.

56,WORLD,"A former Uggs salesman with a rocky marriage has been found guilty of working as a “sleeper” agent for an arm of Hezbollah while living in the Bronx — helping the terror group prepare for attacks on New York City.

After less than a day of deliberations, a Manhattan federal jury found Bronx resident Ali Kourani, 34, guilty on eight counts that included providing support to Hezbollah, which carries up to life in prison.

Kourani, looking business casual in a rumpled white dress shirt and dark pants, sat motionless as the jury of eight women and four men rendered its verdict following a weeklong trial. He was hauled in on the charges in 2017 after he spilled his guts to the feds with hopes of becoming an informant — rather than a convicted felon facing a potential life sentence.

Kourani was born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States legally in 2003, traveling back to Lebanon frequently in the years that followed. He was recruited into the Islamic Jihad Organization, an arm of Hezbollah, in 2008, and soon thereafter began working as a sleeper agent for the group, conducting surveillance on New York City airports and military facilities.

Among his surveillance targets were a Secret Service facility in Brooklyn and two military sites in Manhattan, as well as 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, which houses the FBI’s New York headquarters.

During this time Kourani also traveled to Lebanon to receive firearms and combat training.

But in 2016, during a trip to Lebanon, Kourani says members of Hezbollah fired bullets at his family’s home, and he decided to cooperate with the feds in exchange for financial support and immigration benefits for his relatives.

He met with two FBI agents five times at Seton Hall University School of Law with a defense attorney present, which prosecutors say amounted to five separate confessions. Prosecutors have also maintained that the agents never made any promises that Kourani wouldn’t face consequences himself.

His lawyer Alexei Schact said that he intends to appeal the ruling on the grounds that Kourani was lured into making statements to the agents based on “false statements” and thus his comments shouldn’t have been presented to the jury.

“Mr. Kournai, I don’t know what the future will hold,” Hellerstein said as Kourani was led out of the courtroom.",Former Uggs salesman found guilty of being Hezbollah ‘sleeper’ agent
57,WORLD,"Brazil's mining firm Vale has warned that another dam is at risk of bursting months after the collapse of a similar structure killed more than 230 people.

The dam near the south-eastern city of Barão de Cocais could burst next week if the current pace of movement in the embankment of the mine pit nearby continues, Vale told prosecutors.

The dam contains waste from the Gongo Soco mine, inactive since 2016.

Hundreds of residents seen at risk have been evacuated since February.

The complex, in Minas Gerais state, is located some 60km (40 miles) from where the Brumadinho dam collapsed in January without warning, sending down a torrent of toxic sludge that buried some of the dam's facilities and a village.
• How do you clear tonnes of toxic sludge?

In documents sent to prosecutors, Vale said it was unclear whether the slippage in the embankment of the mine would result in the collapse of the Sul Superior dam, 1.5km away.

The movement was detected by radar and, if it continues at the same rate, a rupture may happen between 19 and 25 May, according to Vale.

It could then cause liquefaction of the dam, a process where the barrier gets weakened as it turns to water. This it thought to be the cause of the collapse of the Brumadinho dam, also owned by Vale, Brazil's largest mining company.

Like Brumadinho, the Sul Superior barrier is a tailing dam - the cheapest and least stable type of structure - used to store waste from mining operations. Vale said work at Gongo Soco mine had stopped in 2016.

The first concerns were raised in February, triggering the evacuation of more than 400 residents in high-risk areas of Barão de Cocais. Some 6,000 other people could be affected and local officials will hold a safety drill on Saturday.

Meanwhile, prosecutors told Vale to keep residents informed about the risks.

There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailing dams in recent years and there have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations around them.

In 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people.",Brazilian mining dam 'at risk of collapse'
58,WORLD,"MEXICO CITY — “Try not to breathe in Mexico City.” That’s the advice of one newspaper columnist as the capital endures one of its worst pollution emergencies in years.

This sprawling megalopolis has been blanketed in smoky haze since last weekend, the result of dozens of forest fires and hot, windless weather at the end of the dry season.

On Thursday, the government took the significant step of closing primary schools, along with limiting public-works projects. It also ordered tens of thousands of vehicles off the streets.

Authorities shut down playgrounds in the capital’s sprawling Chapultepec Park as parents were advised to keep children indoors and windows closed. A semifinal match between first-division soccer teams Club America and Leon was moved from Mexico City to Queretaro because of the air.

The government reported that levels of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less, known as PM2.5, reached 148 micrograms per cubic meter of air Thursday. That’s about six times the daily limit the World Health Organization recommends. Ozone levels were also high.

The Mexican capital has long suffered from smog, because it’s located in a “bowl” between mountains that trap pollutants. In 1992, the United Nations described it as the most polluted city in the world. At the time, the soaring ozone levels were blamed for an estimated 1,000 deaths a year.

The city has come a long way since then, as a result of an energetic effort to replace old cars, expand public transportation, remove lead from gasoline, and close refineries and factories.

Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has been criticized for not declaring a pollution emergency until Tuesday. The leftist mayor, who took office in December, said the city didn’t have protocols to deal with the particulate levels.

“Why didn’t she do it starting on Sunday, or Saturday, when the quality of the air was obviously bad?” asked Paola Virrueta, a columnist for the Excelsior daily. She wryly advised readers to protect themselves by not breathing.

Ping Pong's owner Usa Nisaika went to check the commotion and found an infant's leg poking up from where the dog was scratching.

Nisaika frantically dug up the 5.2-lbs baby and took him to the hospital where doctors said the infant hadn't suffered any serious injuries.

The White House has until midnight Friday (Washington time) to decide whether to impose tariffs on European cars and car parts. However, four sources told CNBC earlier this week that the U.S. administration will delay the decision by six months.

""That's a wise decision,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told CNBC Thursday in Brussels. ""I think we should avoid any kind of sanctions, tariffs and trade war because, you know, the deep conviction of the French government is entering any kind of trade war will have a very negative effect on global growth, growth for the U.S., growth for China, and of course for all European countries,"" he added.

Haftar commands the Libyan National Army, which began an offensive to seize Tripoli from the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord in April.

On Wednesday, Amnesty International revealed new evidence of war crimes in Libya, including indiscriminate attacks on civilian residential areas. Amnesty said satellite images and witness testimony indicated that ""densely populated residential areas in the Abu Salim district of Tripoli were indiscriminately attacked with rockets during an episode of intense fighting between 15-17 April."" Haftar's forces and a local militia affiliated with the Government of National Accord blamed each other for the indiscriminate attacks in southern Tripoli.

67,WORLD,"The barrier that President Trump wants to build along the Mexico border will be a steel bollard fence, not a concrete wall as he long promised, and the president is fine with that. He has a few other things he would like to change, though.

The bollards, or “slats,” as he prefers to call them, should be painted “flat black,” a dark hue that would absorb heat in the summer, making the metal too hot for climbers to scale, Trump has recently told White House aides, Homeland Security officials and military engineers.

And the tips of the bollards should be pointed, not round, the president insists, describing in graphic terms the potential injuries that border crossers might receive. Trump has said the wall’s current blueprints include too many gates — placed at periodic intervals to allow vehicles and people through — and he wants the openings to be smaller.

At a moment when the White House is diverting billions of dollars in military funds to fast-track construction, the president is micromanaging the project down to the smallest design details. But Trump’s frequently shifting instructions and suggestions have left engineers and aides confused, according to current and former administration officials.

[This photo shows why a border wall won’t stop the immigration surge]

Trump has demanded Department of Homeland Security officials come to the White House on short notice to discuss wall construction and on several occasions woke former secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to discuss the project in the early morning, officials said.

Trump also has repeatedly summoned the head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lt. Gen. Todd T. Semonite, to impart his views on the barrier’s properties, demanding that the structure be physically imposing but also aesthetically pleasing.

“He thinks it’s ugly,” said one administration official familiar with Trump’s opinions, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being fired.

The president sees himself as “a builder,” said David Lapan, a former Homeland Security official who worked at the department when it spent more than $3 million on the construction of eight border barrier prototypes near San Diego.

“But building high-rises in New York City is not the same as putting up a barrier at the border,” said Lapan, now at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. “You’re not looking for aesthetics; you’re looking for functionality.”

Homeland Security officials had settled on the steel bollard design many years earlier, but Lapan said many of the prototypes were built using concrete to suit the president’s tastes — and demonstrated that the material was impractical and vulnerable to breaches.

Homeland Security officials declined to comment on the president’s design requests for the barriers and about his conversations with engineers and border officials. An Army Corps spokesman confirmed that Semonite has met several times with Trump and referred inquiries to the White House.

The president — who repeatedly promised to force Mexico to pay for his desired border wall — has pledged to build 400 miles of new barriers by next year, a goal he reiterated during an immigration speech at the White House on Thursday afternoon. The plan would probably require him to reprogram additional taxpayer funds from military budgets.

Trump’s changing tastes are potentially driving up the price. He remains adamant that the barrier should be painted black, despite warnings that it would significantly increase construction costs and maintenance budgets.

“Once you paint it, you always have to paint it,” said another administration official.

Trump also has changed his mind repeatedly about the structure’s height, urging engineers to make it as tall as possible, though his desires have been tempered by cost concerns and engineers’ worries about structural integrity.

The president’s critics are determined to stop or slow down a project they denounce as a wasteful monument to the president’s vanity — more symbolic than security-minded along a border that cannot be completely walled off because of rugged geography and the Rio Grande.

In the compromise deal to end the government shutdown in February, Democrats agreed to provide $1.4 billion for the border barriers, far less than the $5 billion Trump sought. Democrats also inserted language limiting the expenditure to “operationally effective designs” that U.S. Customs and Border Protection already uses.

With the White House using an emergency declaration to get an additional $2.5 billion diverted from military budgets, Trump will face no such congressional scrutiny, potentially giving him more latitude to tailor the structure.

Before her removal from DHS last month, Nielsen had “very specific meetings” on the wall project, another administration official said. She thought the president’s acute interest in the barrier’s appearance became a distraction from more pressing border issues, the official said. Nielsen did not respond to a request for comment.

On the 2016 campaign trail, the president told crowds of chanting supporters he wanted the wall to be big and “beautiful,” and those two qualities continue to drive his requests.

“He thinks not only can the wall be effective, it doesn’t have to be an eyesore,” a DHS official said. “He wants one standard uniform height. That’s what he’s going for, and we have to match that with operational reality.”

The steel bollards remain vulnerable to sawing, but Homeland Security contractors have filled the hollow cavity of the metal with an undisclosed compound to make them more difficult to cut. The material is poured to a certain height — which officials declined to specify, citing security reasons — and ordinary concrete, which is cheaper, is added after that.

One official called the saw-resistant compound a “secret sauce” in the bollards, declining to provide more detail.

Trump often brought up the construction of the barrier at unrelated meetings, and aides learned to bring prep books — and even sketches — to address his questions. He often grew frustrated when he would learn that more of the barrier was not built, the current and former officials said.

He continued to insist on speeding up construction, blanching at suggestions from aides that it would take many years, according to former administration officials. Trump frequently delved into the minutiae of contracts and suggested that some of his friends in New York would have ideas on how to build it faster, officials said.

At periodic meetings to update the president on construction progress, sometimes held more than once a month, Trump has asked questions about how border crossers might be able to “cut a hole in it, dig under it, climb over it,” in the words of a meeting attendee.

Some of the president’s requests have led to significant alterations in the design. In particular, he insisted on boosting the height of the structure to 30 feet, far taller than the 15- to 18-foot range that CBP officials had previously settled on as optimal.

The advantages of the 30-foot design were made apparent after the administration paid for the series of prototypes, another former official said.

“We were able to test what happens when you put someone up that high. They freeze up,” the former official said. “There was significant deterrence value to putting people on a 30-foot wall.”

Said another official familiar with the president’s desires: “He always wanted to go higher.”

Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive, said Trump would get closely involved in design aspects of his hotels, resorts and other development projects. “If it was very visible, he got very involved,” she said.

Res said the president cared deeply, for example, about the kind of marble and brass in Trump Tower, as well as the kinds of floors in the apartments and the kitchen finishes — details that Res characterized as “trivial.”

But for a massive Homeland Security project, she said: “Who cares what color a wall is?”

One design Trump panned, according to a former official, was topped by a rounded, barrel-like metal cylinder to prevent climbing. Approved barrier designs include a flat-panel anti-climbing surface that has been field-tested, but the president doesn’t like the way it looks either, arguing that sharp spikes would appear more intimidating.

Trump told one group of aides that the metal points would cut the hands of climbers and function as a more effective deterrent.","Trump wants his border barrier to be painted black with spikes. He has other ideas, too."
68,WORLD,"Ireland’s prime minister said President Trump will be welcomed to his country during his visit next month – but that protest is not only allowed, it is “welcome.”

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was asked by reporters during an event in Dublin on Thursday what he would say to people planning protests during Trump’s visit.

“I’d say to them, this is a democracy and peaceful protest is part of democracy. And I would certainly never criticize anyone for taking part in a protest if that’s the way they wish to express their views,” he said, according to the Irish Times.

“A lot of people have been very critical of President Trump, including me on occasion, on issues around climate, for example, on his opposition to free trade, on the criticisms he’s made of the EU, on issues such as women’s rights,” he continued.

“I’ll have the opportunity as I’ve had in the past to raise those issues with him in person, but I understand that other people will wish to do so by means of protest, and in a democracy, protest is allowed and is welcome.”

Trump is expected to arrive in Ireland on June 5 after a three-day state visit to the UK and to travel on to Normandy for a World War II commemoration on June 6, according to the newspaper.

He is expected to use his Trump International Golf Links in the village of Doonbeg as a base from where he will attend the D-Day anniversary, the paper reported.

“The president of the United States is welcome in Ireland. And I believe it’s important that we should respect the office even if people have particular views about the current incumbent,” Varadkar said.

Asked if there were any policy areas in which he agreed with Trump, Varadkar paused before saying, “I’m absolutely sure there are . . . it’s always the differences that spring to mind. But let me think about that.”",Ireland’s prime minister welcomes protests during Trump visit
69,WORLD,"Chicago (CNN) Pete Buttigieg wields his military service as both a sword and a shield in his race for the White House. Whether he's reassuring voters about his experience for office or quieting anti-gay protesters , Afghanistan is often his answer.

His six years as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserves, along with a six-month deployment to Afghanistan, makes a gold-plated resume not only shine brighter, but with an air of validation.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is part of a new generation of leaders who came of age after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, and volunteered for service in Iraq and Afghanistan. He and two other presidential candidates, Democratic Reps. Tulsi Gabbard and Seth Moulton, are veterans of those wars.

It's a chapter of his life that he invokes at nearly every campaign stop, a piece of his biography that has become nearly as central to his presidential candidacy as his Midwestern roots or his time as mayor. He mentions his credentials to distinguish himself from not only most Democratic rivals, but also President Donald Trump.

""It helps me demonstrate the difference between how I'm oriented and how the current President is,"" Buttigieg said in an interview here Thursday about his military service. ""We responded to the country's call to serve in very different ways.""

Yet Buttigieg rarely reveals that his path to the military actually came from a presidential race. As a volunteer for Barack Obama's campaign in Iowa 12 years ago, he said he felt guilty that so many young people in rural communities were signing up for the Army or National Guard.

""I might have dragged my feet on it forever if I hadn't had that experience in Iowa and just realizing that some communities were almost emptying out their youth in the military and some were barely serving at all,"" Buttigieg told CNN. ""And I wanted to be on the right side of that gap.""

Asked whether he thought at the time that his military service could help aid a future political career, he replied: ""There have been times in our history when being in the military was popular. There have been times when it's been unpopular.""

He added: ""You never really know when you sign up what it's going to be like over the years.""

While spending five years as a part-time intelligence officer, stationed just outside Chicago, he built his political career in Indiana. He was called to Afghanistan in 2014, just as President Barack Obama was outlining a plan to start withdrawing American troops.

Military records reviewed by CNN show that Buttigieg was part of a unit assigned to identify and disrupt terrorist finance networks. While it was partly a desk job at Bagram Air Base, he also worked as an armed driver for more than 100 trips his commander took into Kabul.

""Look, it's not like I killed (Osama) Bin Laden, right?"" Buttigieg said. ""I don't want to overstate what my role was, but it certainly is something that was dangerous.""

He said he was often assigned the role as driver, which they jokingly referred to as ""military Uber,"" because he was trained to fire a rifle to keep watch for ambushes. Yet explosive devices along the roads presented equally grave danger.

""There had to be at least two people with rifles in the vehicle and I was one of those in my unit who was rifle qualified,"" Buttigieg said. ""It often fell to me to make sure that the vehicle was either being driven or was being guarded properly.""

Jason McRae still remembers the moment he met Buttigieg at the Expeditionary Combat Readiness Center near Fort Jackson, South Carolina. He didn't know the man assigned to be his ""battle buddy"" was also an Indiana mayor.

""One of my early memories was that he had an earbud in and he was learning a language, I think it was Dari,"" McRae said in an interview, recalling that day five years ago. ""Certainly I don't remember other folks that were picking up a language at that point in time.""

A dozen people who served alongside Buttigieg in the Navy Reserves and in Afghanistan, who spoke to CNN, described him as mature and, yes, ambitious. But several said he was hardly alone on that front, particularly in a reserve unit filled with prosecutors, FBI agents and other hard-charging officers.

McRae, who traveled to Afghanistan and back to the US with Buttigieg in 2014, said his friend not only learned a new language, but took an interest in local cultures and studied Afghanistan proverbs. He described themselves as ""middle managers,"" following instructions even as they discussed how the overall mission of the war seemed filled with uncertainty.

""To go through a deployment in Afghanistan, there are probably less dangerous ways to check a box,"" McRae said when asked about his friend's ambition.

""I had no idea at that point in time that he was going to run for president, right? Maybe he did, but I certainly didn't,"" McRae said. ""I have never had any reason to believe he did it for anything other than a sense of duty and obligation to his country.""

But Buttigieg spent most of his military service at the Navy Reserve Joint Intelligence Operation Center near Lake Michigan, where he would drive from South Bend for weekend duty once every month. He joined the unit in 2009, eight months after Obama took office, and volunteered for an overseas deployment.

Lt. Charles Murray, one of the leaders of the unit to which Buttigieg was assigned, said the young reservist stood out from the beginning as an ""engaged and astute critical thinker."" He said Buttigieg was mature and poised, but did not seem to be in the reserves for the wrong reasons.

""I've seen folks there for a paycheck and nothing else. I've seen others do it just because it makes them look better personally or professional,"" Murray said in an interview. ""He never struck me as either of those.""

Several others serving alongside Buttigieg, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had largely positive assessments of his service. They said he didn't stand out, necessarily, until they had conversations with him. After he announced he was gay in a South Bend newspaper column after returning from Afghanistan, people in his unit were surprised, but supportive.

""Nobody had a problem with him,"" one reservist said. ""We knew he was a Democrat and a mayor with ambitions. The only negative thing I can say is that we lost him. The unit would have been stronger if he had stayed.""

Thomas Gary, who now works in the Illinois Treasurer's Office and served alongside Buttigieg, said reservists have been quietly watching the presidential campaign with great interest. He and others said they were not surprised Buttigieg declared his candidacy, but did not see him as ""a young man in a hurry.""

""We do have those individuals who are in uniform on the weekends, punching their tickets,"" Gary said in an interview. ""But it was never my sense that he was one of those guys.""

For Buttigieg, his time in Afghanistan is also responsible for another part of his biography. A year after returning home, he announced that he was gay.

""It was the reflecting that I did while I was overseas,"" Buttigieg said. ""I think it did kind of push me over the edge when I could've found more excuses to just take my time on coming out.""","Buttigieg wields his military credentials: 'It's not like I killed Bin Laden,' but it was dangerous"
70,SPORTS,"Things came full circle for Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum when he met the woman who criticized him on social media last year before Thursday’s game against the Golden State Warriors.

Jennifer Williams responded to McCollum in August 2018 after the guard appeared to be upset over the attention he was getting from comments he made about “ring chasing.”

McCollum’s three-word response appeared to be a rallying cry for the entire season. The Trail Blazers came into the playoffs as a No. 3 seed and defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder and Denver Nuggets on the way to a Western Conference Finals matchup with the Warriors.

Prior to Game 2 on Thursday, McCollum and Williams met for the first time in person.

Williams was sitting between ESPN’s Rachel Nichols and Richard Jefferson when McCollum approached. Williams and McCollum embraced.

According to FOX 12, when McCollum was asked what he wanted to tell Williams, he said: “Thank you.”

71,SPORTS,"Tiger Woods, the Masters champion, will need a herculean effort Friday to pull himself back into contention at the PGA Championship. In Thursday’s first round, playing partner Brooks Koepka bent the course to his will with a sizzling 63, which was nine strokes better than Woods’s 72. Follow along for hole-by-hole updates during the second round, as Woods attempts to remain on the right side of the cut line.

Finally, Woods makes up a stroke. A beautiful second shot — from the rough (again) to within 20 feet of the pin — set up a scoring putt that elicited roars from the crowd, and gave Woods a little bit of breathing room from the cut line.

Woods is 0 for 4 hitting fairways so far, and he is paying the price. He landed his drive in the rough on the par-4 fifth, which contributed to forcing his second shot into a green-side bunker. His short game, though, has improved since his first round. A nice pitch from that bunker put him in easy range to save par.

The par-5 fourth, with its ribbon of bunkers running through the fairway 350 yards out, forced Woods to lay up, and from there, Woods’s second shot couldn’t find the green. After a chip and two putts, one of the best scoring chances at Bethpage Black had gone by.

Woods probably should have had a birdie, after his tee shot landed within striking distance. But his putter betrayed him and his 10-footer lipped out and sputtered four feet away. He settled for par and continues to ride dangerously close to the cut line.

Well, now he’s right on the cut line. Woods’s drive found the rough, again, and he ended up on the green in three. He had a 19-foot putt for par that stayed right and he tapped in for bogey.

Woods opened the round with a bit of breathing room, but he didn’t get off the start he wanted. His drive stayed far left and ended up in the fescue among patrons, and his second shot ran long of the green and into a bunker. A nice up-and-out helped him save par.

Who: Woods is playing in a threesome with Brooks Koepka, the defending winner of this event, and Francesco Molinari, the defending British Open champion.

When: The group teed off on No. 1 at about 1:49 p.m. Eastern.

Online: Coverage of the featured groups is streaming on PGA.com, and is also available on the tournament’s app. A stream is also available through B/R Live.

Background: During his peak, Tiger Woods’s worst-ever finish in a major tournament that immediately followed one of his grand slam wins was a tie for 28th at the 2002 British Open, when his hopes of a calendar-year grand slam were drenched by a third-round 81 amid the wind and rain at Muirfield.

The weather won’t be as dire during Friday’s second round of the PGA Championship at Bethpage Black, but Woods, the Masters champion, will need a herculean effort to pull himself back into contention after watching playing partner Brooks Koepka bend the course to his will with Thursday’s first-round 63, which was nine strokes better than Woods’s 72.

[Tiger Woods has brief surge but is undone by short game at PGA Championship first round]

Missing the cut isn’t out of the question, either. At the start of Friday’s play, Woods’s score of 2 over par sat right on the cut line (the top 70 plus ties advance to the weekend; Woods began the day in a tie for 51st). By early Friday afternoon the cut line had moved to 3 over par. In any case, Woods will probably know the score he needs to shoot by the time he tees off Friday in one of the last groups. That score almost certainly will need to be around par.

The conditions won’t help. Woods went off in the morning on Thursday, when the weather was more benign. On Friday he tees off at 1:49 p.m. Eastern, when the wind is scheduled to pick up a bit and there could be some showers.

Woods played only nine holes of practice golf at Bethpage Black this week in the run-up to the tournament, skipping an anticipated round on Wednesday to the surprise of observers. On Thursday, he revealed he was feeling under the weather.

“I wasn’t feeling that good yesterday, so I decided to stay home and rest,” Woods said Thursday. “I got a little bit sick, so I decided to stay home.”

But he added that his physical condition had nothing to do with his play Thursday, which included two three-putt bogeys on his second nine after a four-hole surge put him under par for the day.

Woods missed one cut at a major — the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills (also on Long Island) — during his comeback campaign last year. After the first round, he sat nine strokes behind the leaders, just as he sits nine holes behind Koepka entering play on Friday.

72,SPORTS,"Steve Bunce looks ahead to the WBC heavyweight title fight and how the division will shape up with Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury also fighting soon. (2:28)

After heavyweight world titleholder Deontay Wilder fought to a draw with lineal champion Tyson Fury in a classic fight in December, the wheels were immediately put into motion for the rematch both men demanded.

With terms agreed to and close to signing the paperwork, Fury suddenly changed course. He and promoter Frank Warren blew off the rematch and signed a co-promotional deal with Top Rank to bring him to ESPN.

With the rematch off the table for the time being and an undisputed world title fight between Wilder and three-belt titleholder Anthony Joshua also not happening for the time being, Wilder had to reset the plans for his next fight. That meant a mandatory defense against Dominic Breazeale in a fight riddled with animosity -- more on that later -- that will take place on Saturday (Showtime, 9 p.m. ET) at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

The fight is a battle of 6-foot-7 former U.S. Olympians with power, which they both plan to put to good use.

""Dominic Breazeale is going to get knocked out in dramatic fashion on Saturday. I can't wait,"" Wilder said. ""He's like a fly in my ear. I'm going to get him out of there in a fashion no one has ever seen. It will be my time. It's punishment time. It's judgment time, and I am the judge.""

Breazeale agreed there will be a KO.

""There's no way this fight goes the distance. I know for sure it's going to be fireworks from the opening bell, and there's going to be a fantastic finish,"" Breazeale said. ""People talk about his big right hand, but this is heavyweight boxing. I have a big right hand, too. I've put many individuals down on the canvas. All Wilder does is talk. We'll see who lands that right hand first on Saturday. I've been training like a caged dog during camp. I'm confident in what I can do and what I bring to the table on Saturday night. It's going to be fun.""

This is your Ringside Seat for the fight.

Oh, boy, is this one personal. Wilder and Breazeale do not like each other. At all.

""I think this is the most excited I've been and the most I wanted to hurt a man since 2015 with Bermane Stiverne,"" Wilder said. ""With this one right here, the story that comes behind it, people have got to understand when you're dealing with Deontay Wilder, I'm passionate about what I say. I'm passionate about what I do.""

The bad blood stems from an incident in February 2017, when Wilder retained his title by fifth-round knockout of Gerald Washington and Breazeale knocked out Izuagbe Ugonoh in the fifth round on the undercard.

Later that night, in the lobby of the fight hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, there was an altercation between Wilder; his younger brother, Marsellos Wilder; Breazeale; and their teams. Breazeale, who was with his wife and kids, alleged he was punched from behind by Marsellos.

Earlier in the evening, Marsellos Wilder and Breazeale had gotten into an argument at the arena, which spilled over to the hotel later. Police were called following the hotel incident but no arrests were made. Breazeale later filed a lawsuit against Marsellos Wilder, which was dismissed a few months later.

The incident has left each man with a severe dislike for the other, so much so that when Marsellos Wilder, a 3-1 cruiserweight, suffered a fourth-round knockout loss in January to William Deets, who was 6-12 and supposed to be a soft touch, Breazeale sent Deets a congratulatory gift.

""It's no secret that there's a personal rivalry from these two guys, so there is no shortage of motivation,"" said Stephen Espinoza, president of Showtime Sports.

Wilder (40-0-1, 39 KO), 33, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is so amped up to get his hands on Breazeale that following a workout for the media this week, he intimated that he wouldn't mind killing him in the ring.

""Dominic Breazeale asked for this. I didn't seek him out. He [came for] me,"" Wilder said. ""This isn't a gentleman's sport. We don't ask to hit each other in the face, but we do anyway. If you ask any doctor around the world, he'll tell you the head is not meant to be hit. This is the only sport where you can kill a man and get paid for it at the same time. It's legal. So why not use my right to do so?""

Breazeale (20-1, 18 KOs), 33, of Eastvale, California, said the animosity would make a win -- and a knockout -- all that more satisfying for him.

""It's going to be a lot better sleeping the night after I win the title if I get a knockout,"" he said. ""Don't get me wrong. A win's a win, but at the same time, I want to impress the world. I want to impress the boxing community with a big knockout. When I say 'big knockout,' [I mean] one where my right hand, my left hand is going to make contact and he goes out. Doesn't get back up.

""The personal thing from the outside of the ring makes the revenge factor. You approach myself and my wife and kids in a situation that was not boxing-related. The gratification -- and the fact that my personal revenge, knocking out Deontay Wilder -- is a lot bigger than just an actual win or KO.""

Breazeale working his way back, wants Joshua rematch

Breazeale, who was a 2012 U.S. Olympian, got a shot at a world title when he challenged Anthony Joshua in London in 2016.

It did not go well. Joshua overwhelmingly dominated the fight and knocked Breazeale down twice and out in the seventh round.

But since suffering his only pro loss, Breazeale has stormed back with three victories in a row, each by knockout, even risking his mandatory status for Wilder's belt in the process.

Breazeale survived an incredible back-and-forth slugfest with Izuagbe Ugonoh to knock him out in the fifth round on a Wilder undercard. Then, Breazeale stopped former Wilder victim Eric Molina in the eighth round (a round sooner than Wilder did in a 2015 title defense) and former Puerto Rican Olympian Carlos Negron in the ninth round in December with Wilder at ringside.

But the question remains: If Joshua was able to so easily dispose of him, what makes Breazeale think he will be able to stand up to the power Wilder possesses?

""I've grown a lot in the last few years. The Joshua fight was an eye opener,"" Breazeale said. ""It was good experience. I learned then that I was standing there a lot more and taking some damage that I didn't need to take because of the big guy that I am. Wilder's got a big right hand, but so do I, and I've got a big left hook. In the heavyweight division, if you don't have knockout power, you've got no reason to be in the division.

""So, yes, Wilder's going to throw some leather and make some contact, by all means. Boxing, it's all about hitting and not getting hit. I don't plan on getting hit a lot, and if I do, I've been there. I've done that before. At the same time, I plan on putting on all the punishment. And if the right hand comes, so be it. I'll deal with it. It's part of boxing.""

In Breazeale's perfect world, he'll beat Wilder and eventually face Joshua in a rematch for the undisputed world title.

""I'm going to put my name in that hat with Joshua, and I definitely want my revenge against Joshua, so we're going to make some things up in the near future,"" said Breazeale, who will go into the fight with Virgil Hunter as his trainer for the first time. ""My way to do that is to get my WBC title, and that's what I plan on doing.""

Breazeale said he suffered depression after the loss to Joshua but pulled himself out of it and went back to school on what he did wrong in the fight.

""My way of bouncing back from that title shot against Joshua was to study the film day in and day out,"" he said. ""I watched it round after round, minute after minute. I watched it in silence. I watched it with people. I watched it without people. And I guess I can say that's the quarterback background in me [as a former college football player]. I wanted to see everything that I did wrong. I didn't want to see anything I did right because I understood there were things that were done right, but there were a lot more things that were done wrong.

""Me and my [now former] trainer Manny Robles went back to California and kind of restructured my boxing skills, and they grew. And lucky enough that we were fortunate enough to have three big KO wins, and here we are back again fighting for the world title. I learned a lot more from that one loss than I learned from all my wins in my whole boxing career and amateur career. So that one lifetime experience in the summer of 2016 against Joshua was a lot bigger for my boxing career than anything could have been.""

Wilder, who took home a bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics, has made eight title defenses and is aiming for No. 9 against Breazeale. That's a notable number in heavyweight history.

Should Wilder retain the belt, he will inch up the all-time heavyweight defense list and join four iconic heavyweight champions who also made nine defenses: Muhammad Ali (during his first title reign), Joe Frazier, Mike Tyson (in his first title reign) and Lennox Lewis (in his second title reign).

The all-time record for any division is 25 by Joe Louis. Others who would still be ahead of Wilder: Larry Holmes (20), Wladimir Klitschko (18 in his second title reign), Vitali Klitschko (11 in his second title reign), Tommy Burns (11) and Ali (10 in his second title reign).

The magnitude of the names with nine whom Wilder could join is not lost on him.

""It means a lot. It means a great deal to me,"" Wilder said. ""It means a lot to accomplish that. It means that I've proved so many people wrong, and still to this day I'm proving people wrong.

""It's going to be a great accomplishment not only in the past -- so many great fighters that came before me, but to continue to go forward to be the No. 1 guy. I've still got a long way to go to do what I want to do in this sport.

""I will accomplish everything I set forth to do. I'm an amazing fighter. I'm an amazing talent, and I've got an amazing team behind me. And with that combination, man, the sky's the limit.""",Ringside Seat: Deontay Wilder and Dominic Breazeale don't like each other -- for real
73,SPORTS,"John Daly's ride at the 101st PGA Championship is officially over.

The event's 1991 champion shot a 6-over 76 during Friday's second round to cap off an 11-over total, putting him well outside the projected cut line of 3-over when he walked off the course.

""I just couldn't get anything going,"" Daly said. ""I missed four fairways by half a foot, and playing out of that rough is difficult. I played good, but it's a major championship.""

Daly's presence was a major point of contention leading up to the year's second major after he received a waiver from the PGA of America to use a golf cart under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Tiger Woods was critical of the decision.

After his 5-over 75 on Thursday, Daly opened up about his feelings on using a cart and his ""obligation"" as a past winner to keep playing.

""It's very awkward (to use a cart), and it's almost to a point where it's embarrassing,"" Daly said. ""I don't want to ride all the time, but if I don't, I won't be able to finish. I enjoy playing and I'm still competitive. It's not really ego; I feel committed.""

TIRED ACT: John Daly show is getting old

Daly plays on the PGA Champions Tour, which allows carts, and said the rules for this week's event were similar to those of the Champions.

""One rule (for the cart) was to try and keep pace with the way the guys were walking … I can't go up past my ball, and I can't drive up and come back, but I never do that on the senior tour,"" he explained. ""It's not far from the senior tour, just a couple stipulations.""

The two-time major champion said he has applied to use a cart for this summer's British Open, held at Northern Ireland's Royal Portrush July 18-21.

""Ireland is big on the ADA, as most countries should be,"" Daly said, noting if he can't ride, he can't play. He has yet to hear back on whether he'll be able to use a cart and is unsure when to expect a ruling.

75,SPORTS,"If the door in Memphis was already cracked open for a Mike Conley trade, landing at No. 2 overall in the 2019 NBA draft lottery should burst it wide-open for the Grizzlies.

According to ESPN's Jonathan Givony, Memphis plans on selecting Murray State point guard Ja Morant with the second pick, a major sign that Conley's 12-plus years with the Grizzlies could be coming to an end.

This could either mean a summer trade that completely resets the franchise following the previous Marc Gasol trade to the Toronto Raptors or waiting until closer to the 2020 trade deadline while allowing Morant to gain experience for a few months.

Predicting Conley's value, however, is complicated.

At age 31, he put up a career-high 21.1 points per game last season while chipping in 6.4 assists, 3.4 rebounds and 1.3 steals and slashing a respectable .438/.364/.845 in 33.5 minutes per game. He's owed a sizable $32.5 million in 2019-20 and $34.5 million in 2020-21, a number that falls to $22.4 million if he plays in 54 games or fewer.

Teams in the market for Conley should be craving a veteran floor general and have the cap space or matching contracts to send back to offset his hefty salary.

For the Grizzlies, the future is all about Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr. and whatever young talent or draft picks they can get for Conley either this summer or closer to the February deadline.

The Pistons made the 2019 playoffs despite having little talent outside of Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. If they want to climb any higher than the eighth seed, help at guard is a must. With no cap space to use, Detroit's best option to upgrade is through trade, using its expiring contracts and its current first-round pick.

This wouldn't be the first time the Pistons made a play for Conley, as they offered up Jackson and a first-rounder before the 2019 trade deadline, per John Martin of The Athletic. Memphis passed on the deal because Detroit wouldn't include second-year wing Luke Kennard.

If the Pistons want Kennard that badly, they'll need to swap in a different young guard instead. Brown started 56 games as a rookie this past season, while Jackson and Leuer represent $27.5 million of cap space coming off the books next summer.

The main draw for Memphis is the 15th overall pick this June, a spot that could land the club a player like Kevin Porter Jr., PJ Washington or Brandon Clarke.

For Detroit, Conley would be a huge upgrade over Jackson, and a trio of Conley, Griffin and Drummond could be one of the Eastern Conference's best.

There may be no team more desperate for point guard help than the Suns.

Getting Conley isn't as much about making a playoff run (which could happen with major leaps from Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton) but more so bringing in a true floor general to maximize the potential of a young roster.

Conley brings stability to a franchise that's had a revolving door of head coaches and front-office members. New head coach Monty Williams knows how to get the most out of his point guards (though it's helped that he's coached Chris Paul and Jrue Holiday in New Orleans).

For this trade to be completed, Johnson needs to pick up his $19.2 million player option for next season. Coming off a year where he averaged just 10.9 points and 2.9 assists on 41.3 percent shooting, that shouldn't be a problem.

His expiring money helps Memphis clean its books, while Warren, 25, put up 18.0 points on 42.8 percent shooting from three last season and is young enough to fit into the Grizzlies' rebuilding plans.

The Suns have the No. 6 overall pick to include now, but that seems a bit much for Conley. Instead, offering up their first next season with a protection lets Phoenix add in one more young core piece for Conley to help mold.

Before Conley signed his five-year, $153 million contract with the Grizzlies in 2016, the Spurs were interested in his services.

San Antonio is quietly stockpiling some good, young guards with Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Bryn Forbes and Lonnie Walker IV. Will Gregg Popovich, the NBA's oldest coach at 70, want to wait on their development?

Getting Conley means one last hope at a sixth championship in the Popovich era, as he'd be joining a veteran core of LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan.

For Memphis, White is the star of this package following his breakout playoff performance against the Denver Nuggets. The 24-year-old averaged 15.1 points, 3.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists in just 27.3 minutes per game over San Antonio's seven-game, opening-round series loss. Morant and White would be an exciting backcourt for years to come.

Bertans, 26, fits into a rebuild and nailed 42.9 percent of his three-pointers for the Spurs last year. Mills becomes the veteran backup to Morant, and Belinelli's $5.8 million deal is expiring.

San Antonio missed out on Conley once but could put a strong package together for him now.

This deal would be predicated on Kyrie Irving's departure in free agency.

Should this happen and Al Horford picks up his $30.1 million player option, the Celtics would have less than $10 million in cap space, even with Irving gone.

With not enough space to sign any of the top free-agent point guards, Boston would have to choose between bringing Terry Rozier back with a significant raise or trading for help. Since Rozier didn't exactly have glowing things to say about the team, a trade for outside help may be the Celtics' best bet.

If Irving leaves, a trade for Anthony Davis seems unlikely as well. That means keeping and building around Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart, with someone like Conley to tie it all together.

Boston has something Memphis would love to have back: its own 2020 first-round pick that's sure to fall in the lottery once again.

Swapping Conley for Hayward, who almost has an identical $66 million remaining over the next two years, means getting an All-Star-caliber point guard for Boston without increasing the payroll.

For the Grizzlies, they get their own rebuilding piece back.

Utah tried to trade for Conley before the February 2019 deadline, and ""multiple league sources said this week that the Jazz are expected to make another push for him,"" per The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor.

A deal for Conley only makes more sense now for Utah, as Ricky Rubio will become an unrestricted free agent this summer. Conley's megadeal also aligns with the rookie deal for Donovan Mitchell before his inevitable max extension kicks in.

Getting bounced in the first round by the Houston Rockets in five games should be the wake-up call Utah needs. While Rudy Gobert is an annual candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, he shouldn't be a team's second-leading scorer like he was this past season behind Mitchell.

Conley gives Utah a pair of 20-plus point-per-game scorers in the backcourt and helps take the pressure off the 22-year-old Mitchell.

Memphis could put the No. 23 pick to good use this summer with someone like Nassir Little, Grant Williams or Cameron Johnson. Allen was the 21st overall pick last year and should become a sharpshooter off the bench.

Favors has a team option of $16.9 million that would need to be picked up by July 6 in order for the trade to work. Favors is a good center on an expiring deal that the Grizzlies could try to trade during the season for additional assets or simply use the cap-space savings next year.

77,SPORTS,"Manchester City star Raheem Sterling believes there is no reason why his club cannot emulate their city rivals and secure a third straight Premier League title next season.

Pep Guardiola's men came back from behind on Sunday to down Brighton 4-1 and pip for one of the most hotly contested crowns in the league's history.

eventually finished on 98 points, one clear of the Merseysiders, and retained the title they took in 2017-18 in Guardiola's second season.

Only rivals United have won the Premier League on three consecutive occasions, a feat they achieved from 1998-2001 and but Sterling is confident that his side can seal their own 'three-peat'.

“I feel we’re always improving, the mentality is always improving and next season will be another massive test for us again,"" he told the Mirror.

“We’ve done it back to back. What’s going to be the motivation now? The motivation has got to be to try and do it again. It’s as simple as that.

“We want to be one of the best clubs in England and in the world of football. “This is the level that we have to reach every year. It’s not just one year and then three years out. Every year you have to be competing.

“It was lovely to retain the title, of course. We knew how long it’s been since a team has retained it and it just shows the mentality in the group.”

This latest title also marked the eighth national crown in the last 11 seasons for Pep Guardiola, who has taken Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City to the top of their domestic leagues.

And Sterling is certain that the Spaniard has lost none of his enthusiasm for the game.

“He’s ready to go. That’s just him. He loves football more than anyone I know!” he added.

“I don’t know what will happen in the summer, you can have additions to the squad, you never know what will happen and as a we’re always improving.

“When you have teams who are playing at a high level, then you have to do the exact same. I think that’s what next season will be like because I imagine every team, all of the top six teams, will be pushing hard.”

78,SPORTS,"Roger Federer might have been forced to withdraw from his Internazionali BNL d’Italia quarter-final against Stefanos Tsitsipas due to a right leg injury, but it’s not all bad news for the Swiss star.

Federer is still firmly in control of the No. 3 ATP Ranking, and leaving Italy with 5,950 points, he is guaranteed to be seeded third at Roland Garros, where he will compete for the first time since 2015.

“I am disappointed that I will not be able to compete today. I am not 100 per cent physically and after consultation with my team, it was determined that I not play. Rome has always been one of my favourite cities to visit, and I hope to be back next year,” Federer said in a statement.

Regardless of anyone else’s results at the Foro Italico, Federer will take a 1,105-point lead over World No. 4 Dominic Thiem into the second Grand Slam championship of the season. The last time the 2009 champion competed on Paris’ terre battue, Federer was seeded second and reached the quarter-finals.

Federer will be in good position to maintain his spot in the ATP Rankings through Roland Garros, too. Since Thiem reached the final last year to earn 1,200 points, the most the Austrian could gain by lifting the trophy is an additional 800 points, which would not be enough to pass Federer.

Depending on Stefanos Tsitsipas’ results in Rome, the #NextGenATP Greek could still have a small chance at surpassing Federer in Paris. But the Swiss holds a firm grasp of World No. 3, and since he did not play the tournament last year, he is not defending any points.

Furthermore, Federer will have a chance at returning to the No. 2 spot. If Rafael Nadal lifts his ninth trophy in Rome, the Spaniard will enter Roland Garros with 7,945 points. But Nadal is the defending Roland Garros champion, so he will drop 2,000 points. Therefore, if Federer outperforms Nadal in Paris, the Swiss will earn World No. 2.

Federer has shown signs of good form during his return to clay this year. At the Mutua Madrid Open, he reached the quarter-finals and held two match points against Thiem before succumbing in three sets. Federer saved two match points Thursday evening in Rome against Borna Coric to reach the last eight before withdrawing.",Why There Is Good News For Roger Federer After Rome | | Tennis
79,SPORTS,"It’s 2019, and the Cleveland Browns are the betting favorite to win the AFC North. Yes, those Browns. The same Browns that went 1-31 from 2016 to 2017. The same Browns that have had five head coaches and four front office regimes in the last seven years. The same Browns that haven’t had a winning season in 11 years, with three times as many losses as wins since an ownership change in 2012. The same Browns that made six first-round picks from 2012-2016—none of whom are currently on the roster. Yes, Browns.

To truly appreciate the Browns’ newfound relevance, you must first be aware of the futility and dysfunction that have plagued the franchise in recent years. To grasp the significance of Cleveland’s rise, you need to recall the years of bottomless toil, the spectacular failures and the dumpster fires . To understand how much Baker Mayfield means to this dedicated fan base, you need to remember Brandon Weeden, Johnny Manziel, Robert Griffin III and DeShone Kizer.

So let’s go down memory lane. Before the Browns renew the annual chase for their first playoff berth since 2002, let’s remember the lowest of the lows and the inflection points in this latest epoch of Browns history. Let’s reflect on the boneheaded decisions and ever-spinning revolving door of quarterbacks that defined an era of Browns football. But let’s also look at the savvy moves lurking in the background that set the Browns up to finally contend.

A timeline of the Browns’ surge to prominence could start in a few places, but starting in 2012, when Jimmy Haslam purchased the team from owner Randy Lerner, seems like a good place to begin.

But remember: These are not 40 steps to building a winner. These are 40 turning points on their journey.

1. October 2012: Jimmy Haslam buys the Browns for more than $1 billion

Haslam, who made his fortune building Pilot Flying J (an operator for truck stops and travel centers that later paid a $92 million fine to settle a fraud case, for a scheme which the FBI says Haslam was aware of ), purchased 70 percent of the Browns for $1.05 billion after previously being a minority owner of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers. It makes sense to start with Haslam because he has been a hands-on owner, directly making many key decisions that have guided the team’s future.

Haslam’s purchase was finalized in the middle of the 2012 season, in which the Browns went 5-11—their fifth straight season with no more than five wins. He announced that 2012 would be the last season in Cleveland for team president Mike Holmgren and brought in his replacement Michael Lombardi to work with Holmgren during a transition period.

2. January 2013: The Browns hire Sashi Brown as executive vice president and general counsel, Michael Lombardi becomes vice president of player personnel and Rob Chudzinski is hired as head coach

he first major shakeup of his tenure. Chudzinski parlayed two years of success as Cam Newton’s offensive coordinator in Carolina into the head coaching job with the Browns. Lombardi, despised by many Browns fans after releasing Bernie Kosar during a previous stint in 1993, had returned to Cleveland’s front office the previous season after working as an analyst for NFL Network. Haslam also brought in Sashi Brown, a graduate of Harvard Law School who had carved out a role with the Jaguars as lead counsel, to oversee the team’s salary cap, negotiations of player contracts and various business responsibilities.

3. March 2013: The Browns hire Ray Farmer as assistant general manager and promote Michael Lombardi to general manager

Less than two months after hiring Lombardi and Brown, Haslam tweaked the front office again, this time a week before free agency. The Browns hired former Chiefs personnel director Ray Farmer as assistant general manager, and elevated Lombardi to general manager, though his responsibilities would remain the same. In essence, Haslam added another voice to the front office.

The Richardson trade signaled an adherence to two of Sashi Brown’s core tenets: accumulate draft capital and clear the decks of expensive salaries. The Browns drafted Richardson third overall in 2012, but he rushed for a disappointing 3.6 yards per carry as a rookie. His value was still high two games into his second season, given his draft pedigree and age. The Browns sold high on a young tailback who would eventually be remembered as one of the bigger busts in NFL history. Getting a first-round pick from the Colts for Richardson was a sensible, forward-thinking move.

5. November/December 2013: Josh Gordon becomes the first player ever with back-to-back 200-yard receiving games

Gordon emerged in 2013 as one of the best wide receivers in the NFL. The 22-year-old, second-year receiver had 87 catches for a league-leading 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns…in just 14 games. (He was suspended for Weeks 1 and 2 for violating the league’s substance abuse policy.) In Week 12 and 13 games against the Steelers and Jaguars, Gordon had 237 and 261 yards receiving, respectively, with Brandon Weeden and Jason Campbell as his quarterbacks. Amid all of their struggles—Cleveland lost both of Gordon’s 200-yard games during a season-ending seven-game losing streak—the Browns appeared to find a star in Gordon, who was named First Team All-Pro.

6. December 2013/January 2014: The Browns fire head coach Rob Chudzinski and hire Mike Pettine as head coach

The Browns went 4-12 in 2013, and fired Chudzinski after just one season. The move drew questions from some players, notably All-Pro offensive tackle Joe Thomas . After a drawn-out coaching search that saw the Browns spurned by several candidates (Dan Quinn, Todd Bowles and Josh McDaniels are among those who interviewed), the team hired Bills defensive coordinator Mike Pettine as a first-time head coach.

7. February 2014: GM Michael Lombardi and CEO Joe Banner leave, Ray Farmer is promoted to general manager

A month after Pettine’s hiring, the Browns announced Banner and Lombardi, who contributed to the decision to hire Pettine, were leaving the organization. In what many viewed as a Haslam-orchestrated decision to clean house, Farmer rose to GM. The timing here—after hiring the new head coach, a month into the team’s offseason—was puzzling.

8. May 2014: The Browns draft Johnny Manziel, Joel Bitonio and Christian Kirksey

The 2014 draft was important for several reasons. Cleveland started with the fourth overall pick, but moved back to the ninth pick and acquired Buffalo’s first- and fourth-round picks the following year in the process. (The Bills took Sammy Watkins fourth.) The move back was indicative of a larger organizational desire to stockpile picks under Sashi Brown—the Browns moved down in the first round four times between 2014 and 2017.

With the two picks in the first round (thanks to the Trent Richardson trade), the Browns made some hefty contributions to their notoriously poor drafting record. After receiving Buffalo’s ninth pick, the Browns gave Minnesota a fifth-rounder to move up one spot. Then at No. 8 they drafted Justin Gilbert, who played just two seasons in Cleveland. They also traded up from Indy’s original No. 26 to No. 22 so they could pick lightning rod Johnny Manziel. Manziel, of course, was supposed to be the Browns ’ quarterback of the future, as the team had waived 2012 first-round pick Brandon Weeden after just 20 starts in two years. Haslam also famously said that a homeless man helped him make the decision to pick the former Heisman Trophy Winner. Well, Manziel started just eight games in two years.

The Browns did make nice picks in second- and third-rounders Joel Bitonio and Christian Kirksey, who have become longstanding contributors. Still, whiffing on two first-rounders set the team back several years.

9. August 2014: Josh Gordon is suspended for the entire 2014 season

After his two-game suspension in 2013, Gordon was suspended for the entire 2014 season after failing another drug test. Gordon ended up playing five games in 2014 after being reinstated, but he was later suspended for the entire 2015 season for another violation of the league’s substance abuse policy, and he didn’t play at all in 2016 after enrolling in rehab.

The Browns thought they found a future star in Gordon, but his inability to stay on the field became a distraction and deprived the many quarterbacks who cycled through Cleveland of a legitimate No. 1 receiving threat. We won’t include each step in Josh Gordon’s saga as bullet points on this list, but you can read a separate timeline of his highs and lows Gordon’s efforts to stay sober

10. February 2015: The Browns sign Josh McCown to a three-year deal, one season after drafting Manziel

The signing of McCown all but signaled the end for Brian Hoyer, who went 10-6 as a starter in two seasons with the Browns. Johnny Manziel started two games his rookie season, but the month before he had voluntarily entered rehab was released from rehab in April and returned to the Browns in 2015, but the revolving door of Browns’ quarterbacks kept spinning.

In the moment, this Week 4 game didn’t seem like it would have major ramifications. It did.

After a back-and-forth, tightly-contested affair, Philip Rivers led a drive in the waning minutes to set up a walk-off field goal by Josh Lambo. The Browns went on to finish 3-13 and earn the second pick in the next draft, and the Chargers went 4-12 to claim the third, so a different result in this game could have greatly altered the path of both franchises.

With that third pick, the Chargers took edge rusher Joey Bosa, who has gone on to become a Pro Bowler. We’ll get to the Browns’ draft a little later.

12. January 2016: In another front office re-shuffle, Paul DePodesta is hired as chief strategy officer and Sashi Brown is promoted to executive vice president of football operations. GM Ray Farmer and head coach Mike Pettine are fired.

More front office turnover: Pettine was fired as head coach after going 10-22 in two seasons, and Haslam decided to oust Farmer, who never hired a coach during his tenure at GM. In turn, Sashi Brown got promoted and Haslam brought in Paul DePodesta, previously the vice president of player development for MLB’s New York Mets, to serve as Cleveland’s chief strategy officer. Brown would have final say on roster decisions, and DePodesta, coming from a baseball background, would take on bigger picture role centered around vision and strategy. (DePodesta would also report directly to Haslam.) If you’re keeping score at home, this new leadership structure would be Cleveland’s third in four years.

The Browns hired Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson a little over a week after firing Pettine. Jackson had previously been a head coach for the Raiders, where he went 8-8 in one season. The Browns gave Jackson, their No. 1 choice, significant personnel control as part of the hire. Other coaches hired around the league that offseason included Doug Pederson, Adam Gase, Chip Kelly and Ben McAdoo.

Less than two years after it started, the Johnny Manziel era came to an end in Cleveland when the Browns cut him. Manziel, who endured a great deal of struggles both on and off the field, will go down as one of the biggest disappointments in Browns history. The Browns signed oft-injured Robert Griffin III, who had been cut after four seasons in Washington, to a two-year deal. RG3 was given the chance to compete with McCown for the starting job and won it before Week 1.

15. April 2016: The Browns trade down with the Eagles in the draft

Remember that loss to the Chargers that helped the Browns secure the No. 2 pick? The week before the draft, the Browns dealt it to the Eagles, who were desperate to move up and draft either Carson Wentz or Jared Goff. They took Wentz after the Rams picked Goff No. 1 overall.

The Browns received a war chest of picks in return: the No. 8 overall pick, plus a third- and fourth-round pick in this draft, plus a 2017 first-rounder and a 2018 second-rounder in exchange for the No. 2 pick and a conditional fifth-round pick in 2017. The Browns could’ve used a quarterback too (what else is new), but instead they chose to move back, netting an immense haul of picks in the process. This kept perfectly with Sashi Brown’s build-for-the-future approach.

16. April 2016: The Browns trade down with the Titans in the draft

Yes, the Browns moved down again in the 2016 first round, even after the trade with the Eagles. This time, the Browns traded with the Titans, who moved up seven slots to select offensive tackle Jackson Conklin at No. 8. In return, the Browns got the No. 15 pick (used on receiver Corey Coleman), a third-round pick and a 2017 second-round pick. More assets for Sashi Brown & Co.

17. April 2016: The Browns draft linebacker Joe Schobert in the fourth round

This may have seemed minor at the time, but Schobert, who made the Pro Bowl in 2017 as a replacement, turned out to be a valuable player.

18. August 2016: The Browns trade Andy Lee and a 2017 seventh-round pick to the Panthers for Kasey Redfern and a 2018 fourth-round pick

Punter swap alert! This one isn’t notable quite so much for the actual punters traded, though Lee was a good punter who made the All-Pro team three times in San Francisco before his one year in Cleveland—but more for what it later turned into. Stay tuned.

19. January 2017: The Browns finish 1-15 after Landry Jones leads the Steelers to a comeback overtime win in Week 17

The final day of the regular season had huge draft implications for the Browns, and it came right down to the wire. Facing a Landry Jones-led Steelers team that had already clinched a playoff berth, the Browns led 14-0 in the first half and even led in overtime after kicking a field goal on the extra period’s opening drive. Jones threw three touchdown passes, however, including a game-winner with 2:57 left in overtime to beat the Browns and ensure Cleveland would earn the No. 1 pick. The Browns entered the game with the worst record in football by a game, but the 49ers would have picked first overall if the Browns had won.

20. March 2017: The Browns trade a fourth-round pick to the Texans for Brock Osweiler, a 2018 second-round pick and a sixth-round pick

This was a surprising, NBA-esque move not typically seen in the NFL. It was essentially a salary dump by the Texans, who had signed Osweiler to a four-year, $72 million deal after he had started seven games for the Super Bowl champion Broncos. The Browns had a huge amount of cap space, and were willing to absorb Osweiler’s $16 million guaranteed salary, in exchange for a valuable draft asset.

The Browns cut Osweiler in September, and paid him all of that $16 million, so Sashi Brown and the Browns’ brass effectively paid $16 million for a second-round pick. As far as cap space and team-building go, this was a creative way to add future value. The Browns would use that second-round pick to draft Georgia running back Nick Chubb in 2018.

21. April 2017: The Browns draft Myles Garrett No. 1 overall

Thanks in part to losing that overtime game to Pittsburgh—not to mention 14 other games—the Browns had the top overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft. They used it on Garrett, a defensive end from Texas A&M. In two years, Garrett has 20.5 sacks and 47 quarterback hits in 27 career games and made his first Pro Bowl in 2018.

Of course this decision meant passing on a trio of quarterbacks who were picked in the first round: Mitchell Trubisky, Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson.

22. April 2017: The Browns trade down with the Texans in the first round

After taking Garrett No. 1, the Browns still held the No. 12 pick thanks to the previous season’s trade with the Eagles. Cleveland opted to pass on a quarterback again, this time dealing the No. 12 pick to the Texans, who moved up to get Watson. In return, Cleveland received the No. 25 pick and a 2018 first-round pick. The Browns used the No. 25 pick to take Michigan safety Jabrill Peppers.

Using the second-round pick they acquired from the previous year’s trade with the Titans—the second time they traded back in 2016’s first round—the Browns selected Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer, taking yet another swing on a QB. The revolving door kept spinning.

24. December 2017: The Browns close out the season 0-16, securing the No. 1 overall pick again

A season after going 1-15, the Browns became the second team in league history to go 0-16. Kizer started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 11 touchdowns and 22 interceptions. A 28-24 loss to the Steelers in Week 17 sealed the winless season. For the second consecutive year, the Browns finished with the league’s worst record.

Watson became the Texans’ starter at halftime of Week 1, and the rookie signal-caller was tied for the most touchdown passes in the NFL when he tore his ACL at practice seven games into the season. The Texans, then 3-4 with legitimate playoff aspirations (in the season Colts QB Andrew Luck missed entirely), turned to a combination of Tom Savage and T.J. Yates in Watson's absence. Houston’s season spiraled, with eight losses in the final nine games, ultimately finishing 4-12. Houston had traded its first-round pick to the Browns to acquire Watson during the 2017 draft, and that pick rocketed up to No. 4 overall due largely to Watson’s injury.

26. December 2017: The Browns hire John Dorsey as general manager and fire Sashi Brown

Enough was enough for Jimmy Haslam, so he fired Sashi Brown after the worst stretch of seasons in franchise history. (Of course, Brown's forward-looking strategy was one reason the stretch was so bad in the short-term.) A day later, he hired former Chiefs GM John Dorsey to become the top man in the front office. Dorsey represented the fourth regime in six years for the Browns, and, notably, he walked into the job with a plentiful arsenal of draft picks and a relatively clear salary cap situation, in large part thanks to Brown. Hue Jackson remained head coach after going 1-31 in two seasons at the helm (and fulfilled his promise to jump into Lake Erie

27. January 2018: The Browns hire Freddie Kitchens as running backs coach and Adam Henry as receivers coach

Despite retaining Hue Jackson, Dorsey shuffled the offensive coaching staff when he took over. Cleveland hired Cardinals running backs coach Freddie Kitchens to the same title. Dorsey also hired Giants wide receivers coach Adam Henry (also formerly of LSU) to the same title.

28. March 2018: The Browns trade for Jarvis Landry, sending a fourth-round pick and a 2019 seventh-round pick to the Dolphins

Remember that punter swap in August 2016? The Browns acquired a 2018 fourth-rounder as part of the trade that sent punter Andy Lee to Carolina, and Cleveland used that pick, along with a future seventh-rounder, to acquire Jarvis Landry from a Dolphins team trying to rebuild and shed future salary. About a month later, the Browns inked Landry to a five-year, $75 million deal. The Browns got a much-needed receiving threat at a reasonable price. Landry was also a former LSU Tiger, who had played for receivers coach Adam Henry in Baton Rouge.

29. March 2018: The Browns trade DeShone Kizer to the Packers for safety Damarious Randall (plus pick swaps in the fourth and fifth rounds)

Dorsey dealt Kizer to take a flier on Randall, a former first-round pick who flashed talent but battled injuries in Green Bay. The Browns moved down in the fourth and fifth rounds of the 2018 draft as part of the trade, but they traded a high-end backup quarterback (at best) for an upgrade at one of their starting safety spots. The Browns also knew at the time they could address their quarterback need with two picks in the top five of the upcoming draft.

30. April 2018: The Browns draft Baker Mayfield No. 1 overall

Finally, the Browns took a quarterback high in the draft. After trading out of spots that became Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson, after taking notorious busts Brandon Weeden and Johnny Manziel in the 20s, Dorsey pulled the trigger on Baker Mayfield, a 6 '1"" former walk-on who lit the country on fire and won the Heisman Trophy at Oklahoma in 2017. Dorsey kept the decision under wraps until late in the process, and the pick came as a surprise to many, especially with a more prototypical option in Sam Darnold still on the board. The 2018 quarterback class was debated endlessly, with Mayfield, Darnold, Josh Allen, Josh Rosen and Lamar Jackson all taken in the first round. Some even advocated that the Browns should take Penn State RB Saquon Barkley No. 1 and then pick whichever QB was available at No. 4. But Dorsey got his man, and now hopes the revolving door at quarterback will finally stop spinning.

31. April 2018: The Browns use extra draft capital to select Denzel Ward No. 4 and Nick Chubb No. 35

After Mayfield, Barkley and Darnold came off the board 1-2-3, the Browns had several talented players available at No. 4, with the pick acquired from the Texans. Dorsey elected to pick Ohio State shutdown cornerback Denzel Ward, who went on to reach the Pro Bowl in his rookie season.

The Browns weren’t done cashing in on Texans draft picks. The next night they drafted Nick Chubb with Houston’s early second-round pick, which they had acquired separately in the Brock Osweiler deal.

32. April 2018: The Browns move up to draft Antonio Calloway

Using the fourth-round pick they got from the Packers in the Deshone Kizer deal, the Browns moved up nine spots to draft wide receiver Antonio Calloway, an uber-talented player at Florida who fell in the draft because of a combination off-the-field issues, including a sexual assault investigation and a failed drug test at the NFL scouting combine. The move underscores what’s become a trend in John Dorsey’s approach to building the Browns: Bet on talent, even if it comes with character concerns. Callaway had 586 receiving yards and five touchdowns as a rookie.

33. September 2018: The Browns trade Josh Gordon to the Patriots for a 2019 fifth-round pick

Gordon had a game-tying touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter of a Week 1 tie with the Steelers, but the Browns opted to finally move on from him after that. The Browns traded him to New England, opening up playing time for Antonio Callaway and closing the book on the turbulence of the Gordon era in Cleveland.

34. September 2018: Baker Mayfield comes off the bench and leads the Browns to their first win in 635 days

Tyrod Taylor began the 2018 season as the Browns’ starting quarterback, but his stint was short-lived. When Taylor left a Week 3 Monday Night Football game against the Jets with an injury, Mayfield took the field for the first time and starred in a comeback win—the Browns’ first since December 2016. Mayfield outplayed fellow rookie Sam Darnold by completing 17-of-23 passes for 201 yards (with no touchdowns or picks), and he also caught a two-point conversion from Jarvis Landry in the third quarter. Mayfield led a 75-yard game-winning drive that spanned nearly seven minutes in the fourth quarter, at which point one thing was clear: The Mayfield era was officially underway in Cleveland.

35. October 2018: The Browns trade Carlos Hyde to the Jaguars for a fifth-round pick

The Browns had signed Carlos Hyde to a three-year deal in March, following Hyde’s four seasons in San Francisco. That was before they drafted Chubb in the second round. They traded Hyde to Jacksonville six games into the season, creating an opening for Chubb to take on an elevated role in the offense. Chubb posted three 100-yard rushing performances in the Browns’ final seven games, including a 176-yard game against the Falcons in November. Dorsey opened up a role for his new running back and added an extra draft pick in the process.

36. October 2018: The Browns fire Hue Jackson and Todd Haley, and promote Freddie Kitchens to offensive coordinator and Gregg Williams to interim head coach

A day after a 33-18 loss to the Steelers that dropped Cleveland’s record to 2-5-1, Dorsey fired Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley, both of whom had clashing views over the direction of the offense. After a Week 7 loss to Tampa Bay, Jackson publicly declared his intention to get more involved in the offense. Amid the rift between Jackson and Haley, Baker Mayfield appeared to back Haley, publicly saying, “We don’t need to change much” on offense. With the dysfunction swirling around the rookie quarterback, Dorsey ousted both Jackson and Haley, and promoted defensive coordinator Gregg Williams to interim head coach. Running backs coach Freddie Kitchen became the offensive coordinator and play-caller. Jackson became the sixth-consecutive Browns coach to get fired after a loss to the Steelers.

37. December 2018: The Browns win three straight games, reaching .500 at 7-7-1

When Kitchens began running the offense, Mayfield began to flourish and the team started winning. The Browns won five of their final eight games with Williams as head coach and Kitchens calling plays, including a three-game winning streak from Weeks 14-16. Mayfield threw six touchdowns to just one interception during the three-game stretch (and seven touchdowns to no interceptions during a two-game winning streak before that).

The last of those three games, a December 23 win over the Bengals, lifted the team to 7-7-1, marking the first time the Browns had a .500 record that late in the season since 2007. Though the team lost its Week 17 game to finish 7-8-1, Mayfield’s play left many Browns fans feeling like they finally had the franchise quarterback that had eluded the team for years, if not decades. He finished his rookie season with 3,725 yards, a 63.8 completion percentage, 27 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, finishing second to Barkley for the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.

When the offseason rolled around, Dorsey had a decision to make about Cleveland’s head coaching position. Dorsey interviewed a host of candidates from different backgrounds, from former Lions head coach Jim Caldwell to Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski to Patriots linebackers coach Brian Flores. Ultimately, Dorsey tabbed Kitchens, the seventh candidate he interviewed, to continue leading the Browns. Kitchens’s strong rapport with Mayfield as a play-caller won the front office over, and a man who was a position coach 12 months earlier become a head coach for the first time at any level.

John Dorsey’s willingness to gamble shows up once again. Like he did with Antonio Callaway, Dorsey decided to bet on talent—despite glaring character concerns—when he signed Kareem Hunt, who had been cut by the Chiefs in November after a video surfaced of Hunt kicking a woman during a February 2018 incident in Cleveland, of all places. The league later announced that Hunt would be suspended eight games for a violation of the league’s personal conduct policy. Dorsey, who was with the Chiefs when they drafted Hunt in 2016, decided to sign him to a cheap deal, despite his checkered past and the backlash that came with the move.

40. March 2019: The Browns trade for Giants edge rusher Olivier Vernon and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.

The Browns sent guard Kevin Zeitler and a fifth-round pick to the Giants in exchange for expensive pass-rusher Olivier Vernon and a fourth-round pick. With 2018 second-round pick Austin Corbett available to provide a cheaper option at guard, Dorsey decided to add Vernon to bookend a pass-rush that features a star in Myles Garrett. With Mayfield just one season into a cost-controlled rookie deal, Dorsey opted to use some of his team’s plentiful cap space to get another talented edge player.

Just days after completing the Vernon trade, the Browns and Giants completed another swap, this one even more impactful: The Giants sent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for a first-round pick (No. 17 overall), a third-round pick and former first-round pick Jabrill Peppers. (Technically the two trades were sent to the league office as one giant deal, even though the two agreements were reported days apart during the legal tampering period.)

Beckham, who had signed a five-year contract extension with the Giants back in August 2018, is reunited with receivers coach Adam Henry, who coached him with the Giants and at LSU, and Jarvis Landry, Beckham’s former LSU teammate. Beckham made headlines for a variety of reasons in New York, but he is second in league history in receiving yards per game. He adds another star to an offense that already includes Hunt, Chubb, Landry and Callaway, not to mention Mayfield at the center of it.

Following the Beckham trade, the Browns’ Super Bowl odds got as short as 14-1 fifth in the league

After nearly a decade of frequent coaching changes, front office re-boots and quarterback tribulations, the Browns enter the 2019 season with greater optimism than they’ve had in years.

Still, as this era of Browns football proves, optimism and splashy offseasons do not always translate to on-field results. If it feels like this Browns team could be different, that wouldn’t be the first time. Just ask Cleveland fans. These 40 turning points show the winding path it’s taken for the Browns just to get to this point, but it’s still unknown how many more it’ll take for them to reach the ultimate goal.

80,SPORTS,"It feels strange that so much of the reaction to the 2019 NBA draft lottery has revolved around the Knicks failing to acquire the no. 1 overall pick. I understand it from a narrative perspective: The Knicks are one of the most popular franchises in the league and play in the biggest city in America, and yet have the worst winning percentage of any team since 2000. But whereas most of that losing was the result of sheer incompetence, this season’s Knicks lost purposefully, tanking in the hopes of being able to select Duke phenom Zion Williamson. And they came up empty, having dramatically sucked for nothing. Failing is funny; failing at failing is almost funnier.

But nobody should have expected the Knicks to get the top pick. The draft lottery is determined by mathematical odds, which gave the Knicks, who finished with the worst record in the NBA this season, a 14 percent chance of winning the first pick. That means they had an 86 percent chance of not landing at no. 1. Despite these odds being widely available to the public, many headlines treated the Knicks’ result as a shock rather than as a highly probable outcome.

You could actually argue that the Knicks had a decent lottery night. The Knicks entered Tuesday with just a 40.2 percent chance of getting one of the top three picks, and a 59.8 percent chance of getting the fourth or fifth pick. The Knicks should consider themselves fortunate that they ended up at no. 3, a spot that will likely give them the chance to take Duke guard R.J. Barrett.

I get why we focus on the story rather than the numbers. I hate math! I am not one of those sportswriters who obsesses over analytics. I am one of those sportswriters who dropped Introduction to Statistics in college because I realized I was hopeless. But in the case of the draft lottery, the entire thing is numbers. Those numbers aren’t particularly difficult to interpret, either: The league straight-up releases the lottery odds ahead of time. They’re all we need to know.

The actual surprises of the lottery? The Pelicans and Grizzlies—who tied for the seventh-worst record in the league—jumped to no. 1 and no. 2, which they had a 6.0 percent and 6.3 percent chance of doing, respectively. The Lakers, who had the 11th-worst record in 2018-19, vaulted up to no. 4, a mere 2.8 percent possibility. As a result of those jumps, the Wizards, who posted the sixth-worst record, fell all the way to no. 9, a 3.8 percent possibility.

But while the odds of the Pelicans, Grizzlies, and Lakers jumping so high were low, the odds of teams like the Pelicans, Grizzlies, and Lakers skyrocketing up the draft board were surprisingly decent. This was the first lottery conducted under a new system designed to discourage tanking, which resulted in a rough night for the teams with the worst records and a fun one for teams that were somewhere between mediocre and slightly incompetent. That’s what the system was installed to do. But will it actually change how bad teams operate?

The NBA has been trying to crack down on tanking for most of the decade. In 2014, a proposed update to the lottery odds earned the approval of the majority of team owners, but not enough to pass. The new odds, approved by the NBA Board of Governors in 2017, are meant to disincentivize tanking by lowering the chances that the league’s worst teams will get the top picks.

To understand one way that the lottery system has changed, let’s return to the Knicks. Last year, the team with the worst record in the NBA had a 25 percent chance of landing the no. 1 overall pick, a 64.2 percent chance of securing a pick in the top three, and a 100 percent chance of picking within the top four. This year, the Knicks had a 14 percent chance of getting the top pick and a 47.9 chance of getting the fifth pick. New York shared those 14 percent odds at no. 1 with the teams that tied for the second-worst record in the league, the Cavaliers and Suns.

The new lottery format strips ping-pong balls away from the worst teams and redistributes them among the merely subpar. And while the lottery chances of any individual subpar team remain relatively low, there are a lot of teams in this class. Under the old system, the teams that finished with the sixth- to 14th-worst records in a given season had a combined 18.8 percent chance of landing the no. 1 pick in the subsequent June’s draft. Now, these nine teams have a combined 35 percent chance. Going forward, it will be somewhat common for bad-but-not-awful teams to get the top pick over horrendous ones.

And while the Lakers had just a 2.8 percent chance of coming away with the no. 4 pick, they had a 9.4 percent chance of picking within the top four. Not huge, but again, significantly higher than last year, when the 11th-worst team in the league had a 2.8 percent chance of picking in the top three.

Here is a table that shows teams’ chances of getting the no. 1 pick or selecting in the top three of a draft under the old lottery system:

And here is a table that shows teams’ odds of landing at no. 1 or picking in the top four in the new format:

Teams that barely miss the playoffs are no longer spectators at the lottery. And because of that, the new system may have an unintended effect: There is now more incentive than ever for midtier teams to lose intentionally. As soon as a team is eliminated from the playoff hunt, it makes sense for that team to drop games—there’s a big advantage to jumping even a few spots in the projected lottery order.

Take the Pelicans. On March 7 of this year New Orleans was 30-37, basically the worst place that any team could be. Technically its playoff hopes were still alive, as it was seven games back of the then-eighth-seeded Spurs in the Western Conference with 15 games to go. But in reality the Pelicans were already eliminated: The eventual no. 8 seed Clippers closed the regular season with just 34 losses. If the lottery drawing would have happened back then, the Pelicans would’ve had the 10th-best lottery odds, giving them a 3.0 percent chance of getting the no. 1 pick and a 13.9 chance of picking in the top four. Yet from that point on Anthony Davis skipped 10 of the team’s 15 remaining games, playing a maximum of 22 minutes in the contests for which he did suit up.

The result? New Orleans lost 12 of 15, finishing with a record of 33-49. That was the same record that the Grizzlies and Mavericks turned in, meaning the Pelicans pulled into a three-way tie for seventh in the projected 2019 lottery order. By falling apart down the stretch, they doubled their chances of landing the no. 1 pick (from 3.0 percent to 6.0 percent, given the tie with the Grizz and Mavs) and nearly doubled their chances of picking in the top four (from 13.9 to 26.3.) Last year, a similar collapse would have mattered far less, improving a franchise’s chances of getting the top pick from 1.1 percent to 2.9 percent, and its chances of picking in the top three from 3.9 to 10.3. The Pelicans should be thankful for every one of those March losses (and for Davis … uhhh, graciously sitting out so that the team could find his heir).

Or take the Lakers. On March 1, Los Angeles was 30-31—if the season ended then, it would have been 13th of the 14 teams in the projected lottery order. I know L.A. would’ve liked to have made the playoffs in LeBron James’s debut campaign with the team, but from March 1 on it would’ve needed to go 18-3 to match the Clippers’ eventual 48-34 mark. The Lakers would have required an incredible stretch just to get whupped by the Warriors!

But the Lakers took a smarter path, losing 10 of their next 11 games. This doubled their chances of picking in the top four, from 4.8 percent to 9.4 percent. Again, this jump would’ve mattered much less last year, boosting a team’s chances of nabbing a top-3 pick from 2.1 percent to 2.8 percent. The Lakers were all but eliminated from the playoff picture by the start of March, which makes LeBron look dumb. Yet because they didn’t try to win late-season games, they’ll add a weapon to put by LeBron’s side. (Or more realistically, they’ll trade their no. 4 pick in a package for a weapon to put by LeBron’s side.)

The new rules certainly lower the impact of large-scale tanking. I can’t imagine a team pulling a Sixers-type Process in the future, considering that team could turn in the league’s worst record and still only have a roughly 50-50 shot of picking fifth. The Cavaliers and Suns wound up getting the fifth and sixth picks; the truly abysmal Bulls will pick seventh.

Of course, I watched this season’s Knicks. There were stretches of March and April when their best player was Emmanuel Mudiay. That wasn’t entirely due to tanking—New York simply didn’t have better players. The Knicks probably could’ve won a few more games if they’d given more effort, but even under the revamped system, losing was clearly their best course of action. By finishing with the league’s worst record, the Knicks guaranteed themselves a top-5 pick, which was better than having the third-worst record and a one-in-three chance of selecting sixth or lower. The new format’s payoffs are smaller for tanking teams, but they’re still larger than the nonexistent benefits of trying to win games with rosters that suck. There’s only so much you can do when you’re in the Mudiay zone.

As long as the league maintains a system that attempts to breed parity by awarding coveted draft picks to failing franchises, tanking will exist in some form. The new odds won’t end it. It still makes sense for the league’s worst teams to tank. (And even if it didn’t, it’s not like they’d be able to win a ton of games anyway.) The new odds just give the league’s worst teams a more difficult road back to competence while giving the rest of the non-playoff field more reason to tank than ever. Purposeful losing will evolve. It will no longer be limited to the crappy few. It’s time for everybody to give tanking a spin.",Tanking in the NBA Won’t Die. It Will Only Evolve.
81,SPORTS,"Ray is a former Broncos first-round pick in 2015, the 23rd overall selection in that year’s draft after a standout college career at Missouri.

Ray’s best NFL season came in 2016 when he had eight sacks, but his production has tailed off dramatically the past few seasons, with just one sack in both 2017 and 2018. Shane has been plagued by injuries, missing 13 games over the past two seasons.

However, Ray is still young, celebrating his 26th birthday on Saturday. After drafting edge rusher Jaylon Ferguson in the third round and reportedly adding Pernell McPhee, the Ravens were still looking to fortify their pass rush after losing Terrell Suggs and Za’Darius Smith in free agency, who combined for 15 1/2 sacks last season.

82,SPORTS,"It looks like Kevin Durant isn't close to returning from his calf injury, after all.

It's been more than a week since the former MVP suffered the injury during Game 5 of the second-round series against the Houston Rockets. While we knew Durant would miss Game 6 of that series, he also wound up missing Game 1 of the Golden State Warriors' Western Conference finals matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers.

After being re-evaluated prior to Game 2 on Thursday, Warriors general manager Bob Myers announced that Durant isn't going to travel with the team to Portland and will miss Games 3 and 4 of the conference finals. The team provided an official update on both Durant's status and DeMarcus Cousins' as well:

Warriors forward Kevin Durant, who suffered a strained right calf in Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Houston Rockets on May 8, has shown good progress since beginning his rehabilitation program one week ago. At this point, Durant is not ready to advance to on-court work. Center DeMarcus Cousins, who suffered a torn left quadriceps muscle during Game 2 of the Western Conference First Round series against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 15 and has missed the last 11 games, has progressed to on-court work, but is still not ready for live action. At this time, the plan is for both players to be re-evaluated again in one (1) week. Both Durant and Cousins were examined by the team's medical staff earlier today.

The Warriors also announced that DeMarcus Cousins has progressed to ""on-court work"" after suffering a torn left quad last month in Golden State's opening round series against the Los Angeles Clippers. There's still belief that Cousins could return to the team at some point during the postseason.

The Warriors won rather easily over the Blazers in Game 1, defeating them 116-94 and never trailing during the final 46 minutes of the game.

This is still a long series and there is optimism that Durant can return, assuming this series extends beyond four games. A potential Game 5 would take place next Wednesday and a Game 7, if necessary, would take place two Sundays from now -- 10 days away.

With the first game of the NBA Finals to take place on May 30, that would give Durant two more weeks to recover.

While the Warriors may be able to get through the West finals without their leading scorer, their destiny isn't as certain in the NBA Finals if they have to match up with the likes of the Giannis Antetokounmpo-led Milwaukee Bucks.

In other words, it may be wise to rest Durant and his calf for the remainder of this series -- especially if the Warriors take a 2-0 lead over the Blazers after Game 2.",Warriors injury updates: Kevin Durant won't travel for Games 3 and 4; to be re-evaluated with DeMarcus Cousins in one week

84,SPORTS,"Heading into an eventual Game 3 win against the St. Louis Blues, Erik Karlsson was due.

OK, now he wasn’t due for something along the lines of scoring an overtime game-winner after fellow Sharks player Timo Meier got away with a hand pass, but Karlsson was due.

Through 16 games during the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Karlsson had not been able to score a goal for the San Jose Sharks. Few would complain about his overall production, what with his 13 assists in those 16 games, but even acknowledging that defensemen take lower-percentage shots, you had to think that Karlsson was starting to get at least a little bit frustrated.

Karlsson ended up with two goals during the Sharks’ controversial 5-4 overtime win against St. Louis, and you wonder if the goals will really start to flow in now, starting with Friday’s Game 4 (8 p.m. ET; NBCSN; live stream). If so, the Sharks stand a great chance to improve on their 2-1 lead in Round 3.

That goal-drought-breaking Game 3 serves as a nice excuse to take a look at Karlsson’s overall work during his first – and possibly only – playoff run with the Sharks.

Karlsson literally limped into this postseason, so it was only natural to wonder how effective he could really be for the Sharks. After San Jose’s Game 1 win, Karlsson explained to Pierre McGuire that things definitely started rough for him, but that his health has improved as the postseason’s gone along.

Despite Karlsson’s assurances, there have been times when it’s been really difficult to shake the impression that the star defenseman isn’t at 100 percent. It’s something that Sportsnet’s Nick Kypreos and others speculated about, and while some of that might merely be speculation, it’s tough not to read too much into any slow pivot, seemingly timid approach, and other bit of body language.

Not needing to be Superman

Remember Karlsson’s epic playoff run from 2016-17, when Karlsson nearly willed the Ottawa Senators to the 2017 Stanley Cup Final, with help from friends like Mark Stone and Craig Anderson? Plenty of hockey fanatics already knew that Karlsson can be otherworldly at his peak, yet for those who stubbornly stood by as naysayers, it was eye-opening and mouth-shutting.

Interestingly, when you look at the simplest numbers of all, Karlsson’s not that far off from that run.

In 2016-17, Karlsson generated two goals and 16 assists for 18 points in 19 games. During this run, Karlsson has two goals and 13 assists for 15 points in 17 games.

But it’s clear that the Sharks aren’t asking him to shoulder the same burden as he did with Ottawa. Most obviously, Karlsson’s seen his ice time shrink from 28:08 per night during that Senators run (when he seemed to be dealing with a lower-body injury as well), to a still-impressive but less Ryan Suter-like 25:34 TOI average with San Jose.

Brent Burns is the big reason why Karlsson’s numbers are robust, but not outrageous … and the Sharks are really leaning on Burns, whose ice time average is at a startling 28:53 per night, up significantly even from his work during previous playoff runs.

When the Sharks landed Erik Karlsson in that trade, the tantalizing thought was that, as two right-handed defensemen, Peter DeBoer could have one of Burns or Karlsson on the ice during almost every shift of a game. That’s pretty close to coming to fruition during this deep run.

Back during his Ottawa days, Karlsson looked impressive from a possession standpoint, and outright outrageous when you considered his stats relative to his teammates.

He often fit that bill during the regular season, yet Karlsson’s fancy stats have been a little less fancy during the playoffs. According to certain metrics at Natural Stat Trick, Karlsson’s actually been on the wrong end of chances more often than on the positive side.

That’s really not such a bad thing overall, though.

For one thing, Karlsson and Burns are facing tough competition, and by logging such large minutes, they’re keeping lesser players from getting swamped in ways that could really put the Sharks in a bind. So maybe Karlsson hasn’t always been off-the-wall amazing like he’s been in the past – quite plausible if he’s nursing an injury – but, to put things mildly, he’s worth the rare mishap.

Overall, Karlsson’s been a gem for the Sharks. Perhaps they might grumble at the occasional mistake, emotional flare up, or bit of detached-looking body language when Karlsson’s on the ice for an opponent’s goal, but they’re likely ecstatic with the ultimate results.

Now, if you’re a team pondering a long-term deal with Drew Doughty-type money? Then maybe you’re more concerned by every wince and slow turn.

That’s not the Sharks’ problem, and if Karlsson really heats up, he could create even bigger headaches for the Blues.

86,SPORTS,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) – Arizona Cardinals All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson has been suspended for the first six games of the 2019 season for violating the NFL’s performance-enhancing drug policy.

The NFL did not specify Thursday which illegal substance Peterson allegedly used.

Peterson can participate in all offseason workouts and preseason games. He will be eligible to return Oct. 14, before Arizona’s game against the New York Giants.

“Patrick recognizes how disappointing this is for everyone in the organization as well as our fans,” the Cardinals said in a statement. “As we all do, he understands that regardless of intent he is ultimately responsible for everything he puts in his body. Our coaching staff and our players are now aware that we will have to play the first six games without Patrick and they understand they have to rise to the challenge that it presents.”

Peterson apologized to fans and his teammates at his foundation’s charity event Thursday night, saying he knew about the suspension for “months.” He did not elaborate further.

Peterson is still one of the NFL’s best cornerbacks at 28. The fifth overall pick of the 2011 draft, he has 23 career interceptions despite teams rarely testing him.

Peterson is a three-time All-Pro and he holds the franchise record with eight Pro Bowl appearances, a streak that will come to an end with his suspension. Under league rules, no player who was suspended for violation of PED policy can play in the Pro Bowl.

Peterson demanded a trade last season before apologizing. He posted a few cryptic messages on social media last month while deleting all mentions of the Cardinals in his profiles.

87,SPORTS,"PORTLAND, Ore. — During a 22-point loss to the defending champs in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, a lot went wrong for the Portland Trail Blazers.

Looking at most of the coverage the next day, it seems all anyone wanted to talk about or write about was how thoroughly the Blazers' defensive scheme failed against Stephen Curry and the Warriors. But focusing so much on the Blazers' defense ignores the real reason they lost Game 1: their offense.

Curry certainly did go off against Portland, hitting nine 3-pointers on his way to 36 points. Portland decided to drop its big men in the pick-and-roll, which allowed Curry to come off screens and rise up for a ton of open 3-point looks. Eleven of Curry's 15 3-point attempts were open, with no defender within four feet. Seven of his nine makes on the night were open.

LISTEN: The Trail Blazers can win Game 2. Here's how

Listen to the most recent edition of the 3-on-3 Blazers podcast

Blazers coach Terry Stotts, who offered a terse response to a question from The Athletic's Anthony Slater about the Blazers' defensive scheme after Game 1, apologized to Slater on Wednesday for his sarcastic answer, and acknowledged he needs to rethink his pick-and-roll coverages against the Warriors.

That's good. Stotts has shown the ability to make sound adjustments both during and between games so far in these playoffs — look at Game 2 and Game 7 of the Denver series — and I expect we'll see some changes in Game 2 of the conference finals.

But focusing so much on the Blazers defense seems to be missing the point, in my opinion. It's not like Portland, or any team in the NBA, has many viable schemes to slow the Warriors. Whatever defense the Blazers employ, the Warriors are probably going to score a lot and hit a lot of 3-pointers. That's what the Warriors do. They're a dominant offensive team for which there are few answers.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr said as much Wednesday.

""Nothing surprised us about last night. You're talking about Steph Curry, a guy who's done this — I mean, he had 33 in the second half against Houston the other night,"" Kerry said. ""Sometimes the schemes don't matter.""

The Blazers employ the defensive scheme they do because it's what works best for them. It fits their personnel, it's what they practice, and it's what they're familiar with. Stotts can, and should, make some adjustments to the scheme and throw a few different looks at the Warriors. But he shouldn't change the scheme altogether. No matter what adjustments are made, odds are the Warriors will continue to score.

Whatever defensive adjustments Stotts makes or doesn't make, I still feel like we're so focused on the Blazers' defense in Game 1, that we're ignoring the real reason they lost the first game in Oakland: their offense.

The Blazers shot 36% from the field. They shot 25% from the 3-point line. Portland's star backcourt — Damian Lillard (19 points, 4 for 12 from the field, 7 turnovers) and CJ McCollum (17 points, 7 of 19 from the field, 1 of 5 from 3) — were straight-up bad, and were outplayed by Curry and Klay Thompson. The Blazers were SLOPPY, turning the ball over 21 times, which led to 31 points for the Warriors.

That's why Portland lost. It doesn't matter what kind of defense the Blazers play if their offense is that bad. If the Blazers want a shot at winning Game 2 and bringing a 1-1 series back to Portland, their biggest adjustments will need to come on the offensive side of the ball.

The biggest offensive adjustment the Blazers could make is to move Rodney Hood into the starting lineup. Hood was one of the few bright spots in Game 1, and has been the Blazers' third- or fourth-best player since the start of the second round.

During that eight-game stretch, Hood has averaged 15.0 points and 3.1 rebounds in 25.6 minutes per game, while shooting 56.7% from the field and 48.1% from the 3-point line. In that same time frame, Al-Farouq Aminu has averaged 6.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes per game, and is shooting 32.1% from the field and 20.8% from the 3-point line. Maurice Harkless, in 21.6 minutes per game, has averaged 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds, shooting 46.9% from the field and 21.4% from the 3-point line.

I'd keep Harkless in the starting lineup for now, which would allow the Blazers to switch defensive roles so he's the primary defender on Curry, much like we saw after Game 1 of the second-round series against the Nuggets, when Harkless was moved onto Jamal Murray. Lillard was Curry's primary defender in Game 1, but he died on too many screens, which allowed Curry to take advantage of the Blazers' conservative defensive scheme. Harkless is better at maneuvering through screens than Lillard, and has more length to contest, which could reduce the number of open looks Curry gets from 3.

That pushes Aminu to the bench. His minutes have already been dropping as the Blazers have advanced deeper into the playoffs. After averaging 32.2 minutes through the first nine games of the playoffs, Aminu has averaged just 16.6 minutes per game over the past four, during which he's averaged 4.0 points, 3.5 rebounds and shot the ball poorly. Those minutes have been given mostly to Hood, who has averaged 26.0 minutes over the past four games, and Zach Collins, who has averaged 22.8 minutes over the same time frame.

The Warriors' defense in Game 1 was reminiscent of the Pelicans' scheme last season, where Lillard saw two and three defenders at every turn. It's never been more important to surround Lillard with offensive talent on the wing. Harkless showed well in Game 1, with an active 17 points, so keep him in the lineup with Lillard, and see if he can make a difference defensively against Curry. Hood is already playing the fourth-most minutes on the team over the past four games, so the Blazers should just make the change official, move him into the starting lineup, and give him as many minutes as he can handle.

In Game 1, the starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Harkless, Aminu and Kanter played the most minutes of any Blazers five-man unit, and were outscored by 11.9 points per 100 possessions. But the third most-used five-man unit was the same group but with Hood in place of Aminu. Together, that group outscored the Warriors by 9.1 points per 100 possessions. It was one of only *two five-man units with a positive net rating in Game 1.

Make that group the starting lineup in Game 2, and see if that can help free up some space for Lillard and McCollum and get the offense humming again. A good offense is the best chance for the Blazers to make any noise against the Warriors.

88,SPORTS,"The 2019 NBA lottery draft has dramatically changed things for many franchises including the Los Angeles Lakers who now officially have the number four draft pick.

This puts the Lakers in a great position to be aggressive in this postseason, with the fourth draft pick, he may be able to attract a quality free agent or two. The Lakers have recently struggled to find another star to stand alongside LeBron James and turn this team into a contender. There’s certainly been a lot of talk about the Lakers wanting to target players such as Kawhi Leonard since it’s rumored that he wants to return home to the Los Angeles.

However, if things don’t work out for the Lakers, they may have an opportunity to look at picking up Washington Wizards’ All-Star Bradley Beal.

“Bradley Beal could maybe be in play for the Lakers right there,” NBC Sports Washington’s Chris Miller said Tuesday night on the Wizards Talk podcast. “If [the Lakers] strike out on all of those [top-tier free agents] and they need an All-Star and they need a two guard, Bradley Beal is a whole hell of a lot better than Jarrett Culver.”

Jarrett Culver is someone who the Lakers are considering to draft with the fourth draft pick but if they choose to trade that pick, they could certainly find a better value.

The Lakers also have a wide range of young talented players who could be used as trade bait, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, and Brandon Ingram could all easily be on the table. This was proven when the franchise made a bold move for the Pelicans’ superstar Anthony Davis, the Lakers were willing to give up just about anything but LeBron James to make a deal with New Orleans.

The Washington Wizards would have plenty to think about too if the Lakers came to them with an offer, Bradley Beal may soon be eligible for a supermax extension contract that would add up to an incredible 35 percent of the Wizards cap space. Along with All-Star John Wall, this would be two Wizards players who own 70 percent of the team’s cap space.

However, if they do give up Beal to the Lakers, the Wizards will sure be looking to gain some serious rewards for him.",NBA Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Could Target Bradley Beal This Summer

91,SPORTS,"One of the Kansas basketball coaching staff’s biggest recruiting targets is officially off the board.

Five-star forward Precious Achiuwa committed Friday to join the Memphis Tigers, according to multiple reports.

Considered a talented modern forward by various recruiting experts, the 6-foot-9 Achiuwa became the second prospect in the past week to pick Memphis when Kansas also was in the mix. This past weekend Rayjon Tucker, a graduate transfer guard from Arkansas-Little Rock, also committed to the Tigers, coached by former NBA all-star Penny Hardaway.

Achiuwa is the second five-star prospect in Memphis’ loaded 2019 recruiting class, joining 7-footer James Wiseman. Achiuwa at this point is considered a likely lottery pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, while Wiseman is currently a frontrunner to go No. 1 overall next year.

Kansas still has some work to do in its 2019 class, but its standing could improve greatly if a couple of standouts from the state of Texas decide to relocate to Lawrence.

Several recruiting experts consider KU the favorite to land five-star guard R.J. Hampton, who reportedly also is considering Texas Tech and Kentucky. Hampton did have Memphis on his list of finalists but the Tigers already have three guards in their recruiting class. Plus, according to 247 Sports’ Christian Fowler, Memphis no longer has any scholarship spots to offer with Friday’s news that Achiuwa will join the program.

Hampton, a 6-5 guard from Little Elm, Texas, happens to be friends with newly available four-star prospect Jalen Wilson. A 6-8 forward from Denton, Texas, Wilson this week announced he was requesting a release from his letter of intent with Michigan, citing the Wolverines’ unexpected head coaching change.

Wilson told 247 Sports’ Brian Snow he plans on looking at KU, North Carolina, Oklahoma State and Florida, while also considering Michigan.

KU currently has three players in its 2019 recruiting class, all of them rated four-star talents by Rivals: 6-9 forward Tristan Enaruna, 6-6 wing Christian Braun and 6-0 guard Isaac McBride.",5-star forward Precious Achiuwa commits to Memphis
92,SPORTS,"Novak Djokovic takes on Juan Martin del Potro as part of a blockbuster quarter-final lineup at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia. The day session saw Rafael Nadal win an all-Spanish affair over Fernando Verdasco and Diego Schwartzman reach his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final over Kei Nishikori. Roger Federer withdrew ahead of his match against Stefanos Tsitsipas due to a leg injury.

World No. 1 Djokovic leads his FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry with Del Potro 15-4. He’s won their past five matches and all three of their previous meetings on clay. The Serbian has been ruthless so far in Rome, dropping just seven games in his first two rounds. He’ll look to continue his pattern of stepping up against the world’s best. Djokovic is 18-1 against Top 10 players since Wimbledon 2018.

Djokovic and Del Potro have faced off twice before in Rome (2009 and 2017), with both meetings also coming at the quarter-final juncture and Djokovic winning each time in straight sets.

“With that serve and forehand, it doesn't really matter what surface you play on. It's quite a weapon that he has,” said Djokovic of the Argentine. “He’s very tall and uses that height really well. He's very smart with the way he moves around the court.

“It's going to be a great challenge. We had battles throughout our careers. I love him as a person. He's a lovely guy, really nice guy. It's unfortunate that he struggled throughout his career with injuries. But he's always, in my eyes, one of the best players in the world.”

Del Potro is up and running again this week, scoring his first two wins since February as he continues his comeback from a fractured right kneecap sustained last October at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The World No. 9 in the ATP Rankings seeks his 11th win over a World No. 1 and first clay-court Masters 1000 semi-final in seven years.

He set the tone and hired talented people that put in place a plan to build the Blue Jackets through the draft and player development with the end goal being a team that could compete and have success at the highest-level on a yearly basis.

""The winning culture that now is entrenched in all of us will continue under the direction of Jarmo Kekalainen, who will now serve as an alternate governor in addition to general manager, and the leaders within our hockey operations department. We remain committed to improving on the successes we've had in recent seasons with the goal of bringing a Stanley Cup championship to Columbus.""

94,SPORTS,"A North Carolina fencing coach accused Penn State’s head fencing coach of failing to report her accusation that one of their assistants groped her while on a plane, a notification which is required by the school.

Jennifer Oldham, a coach at the Mid-South Fencers’ Club in Durham, told the Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday she was aboard a flight in December 2017 with a group of other coaches when Penn State assistant George “Gia” Abashidze, who appeared to be inebriated, asked her to have sex and grabbed her crotch.

“The part that I felt was crossing the line completely was when he wasn’t just asking me to have sex. He was insisting on having sex, begging me to have sex, creating and visualizing different ways we could have sex. And he was going to die if we couldn’t have sex,” Oldham told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Oldham said she told Nittany Lions head coach Wes Glon about the incident in February 2018. She said she asked him, “If he does this to me, what about your students?”

The woman also said Abashidze apologized to her in a hotel lobby, saying “he was sorry multiple times,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, citing Oldham’s complaint to Penn State.

Oldham said Glon failed to report her allegation to the university. Oldham’s husband eventually contacted school officials in June, according to the newspaper.

In August, a separate SafeSport investigation suspended Abashidze for three years and Penn State placed the coach on administrative leave. An appeal of the SafeSport decision reduced Abahsidze’s suspension to one year, the Inquirer reported.

Penn State released its investigation report in February and terminated Abashidze in March. Abashidze reportedly denied Oldham’s account of the incident.

It’s unclear if Glon faced discipline. Penn State spokesman Lawrence Lokman told the newspaper that school policy prohibited him from discussing whether Glon was penalized in any matter.

97,SPORTS,"Having punched their ticket to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2013, the Bruins are now playing the waiting game to see who they will face next as the St. Louis Blues and San Jose Sharks battle it out in the Western Conference finals. The Sharks lead the series, 2-1. Should it go the distance, Game 7 would be played Thursday.

The Bruins have home-ice advantage regardless of who wins the West. Here’s a look at both possible opponents in the Stanley Cup Final.

How they got here: After finishing second in the Pacific Division to Calgary with 101 points, the Sharks opened the playoffs against the Las Vegas Golden Knights, and won a wild seven-game series.

Facing elimination in Game 6, the Sharks won on the road in double overtime to send the series back to San Jose.

They trailed, 3-0, in the third period of Game 7, but took advantage of a controversial five-minute major call with 10:37 remaining, scoring four goals with the man advantage and eventually winning in overtime.

The Sharks faced the Colorado Avalanche in the second round, and were again pushed to seven games. San Jose prevailed, thanks in part to a favorable replay review that overturned what would have been a game-tying goal for the Avalanche, allowing the Sharks to hold on and advance to the conference final.

Joe Thornton: Jumbo Joe facing his former team would be the big story line. Now in his 21st season, Thornton is still getting it done, notching 16 goals and 35 assists during the regular season. He had two goals in San Jose’s controversial Game 3 win over the Blues.

Logan Couture: The 30-year-old has been the star of the postseason for the Sharks. He has a playoff-leading 14 goals and 20 points. He had 27 goals and 43 assists.

Joe Pavelski: The free agent to be has played an inspirational role for the Sharks. He suffered a gruesome head injury in Game 7 of the first-round series, which caused him to miss the first six games of the second round against the Avalanche, but he returned for Game 7, notching a goal and an assist to send San Jose to the conference final.

Erik Karlsson: Bruins fans are well aware of this defenseman from his time with the Ottawa Senators, particularly his play in the 2017 playoffs, when he helped Ottawa prevail over the Bruins in six games in the first round. The Senators reached the Eastern Conference finals before losing to the Penguins in seven games. He was traded to San Jose last offseason, and helped stabilize their defense after missing considerable time with a groin injury.

Brent Burns: The veteran defenseman is a Norris Trophy candidate who is dangerously offensive, recording 16 goals and 76 assists this season, and five goals and 10 assists in the playoffs.

Martin Jones: The short-term Bruins goalie (four days in between trades in the summer of 2015), Jones backstopped the Sharks to the Stanley Cup Final in 2016. This has not been his best year, with a 2.94 goals against average and an .894 save percentage in the regular season. Those numbers have improved slightly in the playoffs, where he has a 2.89 GAA and .903 save percentage in 17 playoff games.

One of the big storylines would be Bruins forward David Backes skating against the team he played 10 seasons with, the last five of which he served as the captain before signing with the Bruins in the summer of 2016.

How they got here: The Blues were floundering during the regular season and did not appear to be headed for the playoffs. They made a coaching change, firing Mike Yeo and replacing him with Craig Berube, and proceeded to go 38-19-6 the rest of the way.

A third-place finish in the Central division left the Blues opening up the playoffs at Winnipeg, where they were able to knock off the Jets in six games A second-round matchup with Dallas Stars was next, and St. Louis appeared to be in trouble when the Stars took Games 4 and 5 to bring a 3-2 lead back to Dallas. But St. Louis took a 4-1 decision on the road before closing out the series with a dramatic double-overtime win back home in Game 7.

They’ve got your number: While the Blues were going on their run to reach the playoffs, they picked up a new celebration song, “Gloria,’’ the 1982 hit by the late Laura Branigan. The trend dates back to when Alexander Steen, Joel Edmundson, Robert Bortuzzo, Jaden Schwartz and Robby Fabbri watching the Eagles-Bears NFC Wild Card game in Philadelphia. Chris Pinkert had the full story on NHL.com.

Jordan Binnington: The rookie goalie went 24-5-1 with an NHL-leading 1.89 GAA and .927 save percentage.

Ryan O’Reilly: The 10-year veteran had his most productive season with 28 goals and 49 assists to be the leading point-getter for St. Louis.

Vladimir Tarasenko: The seven-year veteran was the leading goal scorer for the Blues with 33 this season.

Colton Parayko, Alex Pietrangelo, Joel Edmundson, and Jay Boumeester: The St. Louis defense plays heavy and brings a lot of size, with Parayko, 26, checking in a 6-6, 230 pounds, and Boumeester, 35 at 6-4, 205 pounds. They have formed the top pairing in the playoffs. Pietrangelo, 29, is 6-3, 210 pounds and is in the second pairing with Edmundson 6-4, 215 pounds.",What the Bruins are up against in the Stanley Cup Final
98,SPORTS,"He was also quick to point out his disillusionment with the college game wasn’t why he left.

CHICAGO — College basketball has changed dramatically since John Beilein started at Erie Community College many years ago, and many would argue it’s for the worse. Former Michigan head coach John Beilein admitted Thursday there were trends he didn’t like.

“I think, like everything, the college game is going through a tough trend with a lot of things,” Beilein said. “We’ll talk about that later on. Bu the college game has really been good to John Beilein and his family, and all the players and universities we’ve been at. 



“That’s not the reason I’m going. The reason is this opportunity in Cleveland is tremendous.”

It was never a dream to coach in the NBA, Beilein said, though it was always an option. When the opportunity came that he could do ever more “pure coaching,” he said he thought long and hard about it and made what he felt was the right decision.

He’ll spend his time now adapting to the NBA game, watching film over the summer and preparing for his first season with the Cavs.

“Many people tell me it’s what we’ve always run but with pro players, read and react type of stuff, not as many set plays as organized ball screens,” Beilein said.

The job has given him a shot of energy, he added. Interviewing players has been a highlight.

But it was hard to say goodbye to his players and coaches, Beilein admitted. He had separate texts for each one Sunday night and started sending them Monday when the news broke. He plans to see them again and will keep his home in Ann Arbor while renting in Cleveland.

“I just thought about our players, our coaches and recruits. It’s really hard to recruit some of these guys they all ask me how long I’ll coach,"" said. ""I planned on coaching, but it’s a difficult business now. Players come and go; coaches come and go.”

101,SPORTS,"Since the start of spring training, the new Orioles management was clear that a main priority of this team was going to be the defense. Speaking to reporters back on April 20th, Brandon Hyde explained:

If this is the game plan, over the last few weeks it’s been a little hard to tell. The O’s committed two errors against the Yankees in Wednesday’s doubleheader, but there were many more embarrassing lapses that didn’t make the scoreboard, like Stevie Wilkerson missing the cutoff man on a Luke Voit double that allowed DJ LeMahieu to score from first, Wilkerson and Mancini bumping into each other going after a fly ball in right, and a single by newcomer Kendrys Morales in the eighth that hit off Hanser Alberto’s glove.

As the season has crept on, the O’s are slinking down league tables in errors committed per game, and some of those plays really don’t pass the laugh test.

There was this diving attempt by Stevie Wilkerson on a ball slicing away from him that led to a two-run Kole Calhoun triple. It wasn’t a catchable ball, but it wasn’t a good look, either.

Then there was this play—one of the clear low points of the season thus far. You didn’t forget about this play, did you?

Pour one out for Jesús Sucre and Cedric Mullins.

The “no shit, Sherlock” explanation for these miscues is that they’re the result of players playing outside of their natural positions. There’s a reason for this: portions of the lineup have been unexpectedly cold, and Brandon Hyde is trying to plug those holes. The bad news is that the more he’s done so, the more he’s sending out unproven gloves into the field, and the leakier the defense is getting.

In his first quarter-season as a manager, Hyde has proven himself to be the opposite of a standpatter. He pulls struggling pitchers early. When it comes to bullpen roles, he keeps the guys guessing. He tinkers relentlessly with the lineup. And he’s had no qualms about moving people around in the field, whether this means starting Renato Núñez in left, Wilkerson in center, or Hanser Alberto in every spot on the diamond except shortstop, center, first, and catcher (seriously).

The O’s have emphasized “versatility” in their players, and Hyde likes it that way:

But so much moving around has led to some very fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants defensive alignments, and some very ugly plays, as you can see. I admit, it’s kind of fun to turn on the TV and go, Renato Núñez is starting where? But is this what we should be doing a quarter of the way through the regular season?

The question is not whether Hyde should be delivering fans a lineup that performs at a high level on both sides of the ball, because, as far as I can tell, he can’t. The Orioles roster is, for now, one great big game of Whack-a-Mole: thwack a mole in the middle of the batting order and another will spring up in center field. Either way, this will cease to matter as soon as mid-season, when the lineup changes over as players are dealt off and prospects called up.

Going into the future, the more important question is whether Hyde’s hot-button roster decisions are contributing to bad results by moving guys around too much, thereby thwarting player development or watering down the defense so much that it drowns out the offensive improvements. Does Hyde have his players on too short a leash? The argument here is that the nature of a non-competing team is to give new guys long looks (one more reason this season sometimes feels like an extended spring training), and that that guys like Richie Martin and Cedric Mullins need regular at-bats in order to develop.

I’m going to go with a tentative no here, although I’m not 100% convinced that Hyde doesn’t have an overactive trigger finger. (It’ll be interesting to see whether the roster tinkering cools down over the rest of the season and beyond, when the tradeoffs between hitting and the D are hopefully less stark.)

Those who Hyde has benched for their bats, guys like Sucre and Mullins, didn’t just go through cold streaks, they strung together at-bats that gave real reason to question whether they could hit at a major league level, period. Richie Martin I’m divided about: he has shown pluck and a good batting eye that allows him to extend at-bats with two strikes, but the fact that he remains in the bottom 2% of league hitters in strikeout and hard-hit ball percentages gives no reason for questioning Hyde’s decision to use him as a platoon player.

And the guys who have gone into the field in their stead—Alberto, Núñez, and Wilkerson—have certainly made their case with the bat, if not with the glove. (To be fair, Wilkerson, who has a 0.1 UZR in CF so far, has done a thoroughly commendable job there considering his next-to-nil experience.)

Plus, where there have been bright spots on both sides of the ball, Hyde has let them play: Pedro Severino leads the league in caught stealing percentage, while showing more pop than ever in his career. It’s nice to have a consistent presence in the lineup, and one real outfielder, even if Dwight Smith Jr. is playing solid, not spectacular defense. Chris Davis remains a plus defender at first, and is getting more regular starts there now that the bat has come around. (As for Trey Mancini, a lot can be forgiven out in the field for that bat.)

A good craftsman never blames his tools, but it seems that Brandon Hyde is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The best baseball teams can field a productive offense and a run-saving defense, but for now, the Orioles can’t, it seems, have their cake and eat it too.",Brandon Hyde is playing Whack-a-Mole with the Orioles lineup
102,SPORTS,"Wayne Rooney feels too many underperforming players at Manchester United are looking for “someone to hide behind”, with there no fear factor at Old Trafford anymore.

The former Red Devils striker has watched on from afar in 2018-19 as those at Old Trafford have endured another forgettable campaign.

Things started badly under Jose Mourinho, improved briefly upon Ole Gunnar Solskjaer taking the reins, but ended with a whimper during a run of two wins in 12.

Serious questions have been asked of several members of a supposedly star-studded squad, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku coming in for criticism .

Rooney has queried the focus of those on United’s books, with there seemingly too many off-field distractions, and called for greater authority from those in the dugout.

The former England international enjoyed considerable success during Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign with the Red Devils and believes that kind of guidance is needed once more.

United’s all-time leading goalscorer told the Wayne Rooney Podcast of goings on in Manchester and his hopes for the future: “I think the players need to fear someone.

“They need to fear Ole Gunnar. They need to fear Michael Carrick. They need to respect them but fear them also.

“The way the game has gone has changed, society has changed. You have got social media.

“You have got players losing a game and posting something on social media about their new clothing range, their new aftershave, whatever they're bringing out, which I find remarkable.

“When fans speak up on it and say 'why are you posting that?' they always have the marketing people to blame, [but] take responsibility.

“They work for you. Those marketing people work for you. I have people who do similar stuff for me and they never do anything without my instructions.

“If that is what you're doing, you're sitting at the top of that business. You have to take responsibility for them.

“These players almost always like to find someone to hide behind, whether that is on their social media or on the football pitch and that's what they are doing.”

Rooney left Old Trafford in the summer of 2017, bringing a memorable 13-year spell at United to a close.

103,SPORTS,"Carlos Gomez is making his return to the Mets.

The outfielder was informed after his Triple-A Syracuse game on Thursday that the Mets were selecting his contract and will join the team in Miami, a source told SNY's Andy Martino.

It is still unclear who Gomez will be replacing on the Mets' roster, but it is likely Michael Conforto, who could be placed on the 7-day IL after he was diagnosed with a concussion on Thursday and sent to New York for further evaluation.

The Mets could also designate Keon Broxton for assignment. He is hitting an anemic .143/.208/.163 slash line with four walks and 22 strikeouts in 53 plate appearances.

Gomez, 33, was signed by the Mets to a minor-league deal in Spring Training and has hit .270/.329/.500 with six home runs and 22 RBI in 35 games with Syracuse.

The veteran outfielder came up through the Mets' farm system and played in 58 games his rookie season with the Mets in 2007 but was traded to the Minnesota Twins that offseason as part of the deal that landed the Mets Johan Santana.

Gomez nearly returned to the Mets at the 2015 trade deadline that would have sent Wilmer Flores and Zack Wheeler to the Milwaukee Brewers but the deal was nixed due to concerns over Gomez's right hip.

The Mets traded for Yoenis Cespedes instead, which helped them win the NL pennant.

104,SPORTS,"Grumpy Cat, the feline famous on the internet for her permanent scowl, has died aged seven, her owners say.

A statement says she died on Tuesday following complications from a recent urinary tract infection.

The cat from Arizona had ""helped millions of people smile"".

Grumpy, whose real name was Tardar Sauce, went viral in 2012 after photographs of her sour expression emerged online. Her image quickly spread as a meme.

According to owner Tabitha Bundesen, her facial expression was caused by feline dwarfism and an underbite.

Grumpy Cat travelled the world making television appearances and in 2014 even starred in her own Christmas film.

Madame Tussauds in San Francisco unveiled a waxwork of her in 2015.

Her Instagram account has more than two million followers.

Grumpy's face has starred in thousands of memes with many people choosing to share them again after hearing the news of her death.

American actress Aubrey Plaza, who played the voice of the cat in the 2014 film, said her ""heart was broken"".

In 2018, the cat's owners won a $710,000 (£555,000) payout in a copyright lawsuit.

Grumpy Cat Limited sued the owners of the US coffee company Grenade for exceeding an agreement over the cat's image.

The company only had rights to use the cat to sell its ""Grumppuccino"" iced drink, but was also selling other Grumpy products.

Ms Bundesen previously worked as a waitress before her beloved pet gained internet stardom. She told the Express newspaper that she quit her job ""within days"" of Grumpy's first appearance on social media.",Internet legend Grumpy Cat dies
105,SPORTS,"Former Penn State quarterback Tommy Stevens tells 247Sports he’s transferring to Mississippi State. He also considered Miami (Ohio), Illinois and Kentucky before choosing to reunite with his old offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead who heads into his second year as head coach in Starkville. Stevens will have one season of eligibility remaining.

Comfort was a big reason why Stevens elected to play for the Bulldogs. His familiarity having three seasons under Moorhead was the biggest factor in his decision to play for the SEC program. Stevens also wanted to continue playing at the highest level he could and felt the stage at Mississippi State puts him position to accomplish all his goals.

A fifth-year senior, Stevens is yet to start a college game having sat behind Trace McSorley the last three seasons in Happy Valley. Stevens was projected as Penn State’s likely starter in 2019, but he abruptly entered the transfer portal just days after the Nittany Lions’ spring slate came to an end.

Stevens had surgery to correct an unspecified injury before Penn State’s bowl game last season. Recovery from that procedure limited Stevens during the spring and opened the door for a competition with Sean Clifford.

Stevens' competition at Mississippi State begins with junior-to-be Keytaon Thompson who saw action over the last two seasons including a win in the TaxSlayer Bowl in his first career start in 2017 in favor of injured signal-caller Nick Fitzgerald. He has played in 19 career games, mostly as a reserve, completing 50 of 105 passes (48 percent) for 846 yards and eight touchdowns to just three interceptions. He also gained 672 yards on the ground with 10 career rushing scores spanning the last two seasons. No question the 6-foot-4, 225-pound Thompson is talented but former Top247 recruit has struggled with accuracy. Redshirt freshman Jalen Mayden and Moorhead’s top quarterback target in the 2019 recruiting class, Garrett Shrader, fill out the rest of the room.

A former three-star prospect, Stevens is known as a bruising runner at 6-foot-5, 230 pounds. Stevens has averaged 6.7 yards per attempt throughout his career with 506 total yards and eight touchdowns. Penn State created a sub-package and a role known as “Lion” to get Stevens on the field last year. Stevens has had much fewer opportunities as a passer with just 41 career attempts. He finished 8-for-11 last year with 110 yards and one touchdown against an interception.

Stevens ranked as the No. 647 overall player in the 2015 class, per the 247Sports Composite. He was a signee in James Franklin’s first full cycle class at Penn State.",Mississippi State lands QB transfer Tommy Stevens
106,SPORTS,"“This is the Brook we all know and we all love,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “We just want him to be aggressive, especially in this series.”

[Does a guy working security in Milwaukee look familiar? He should. He used to play for the team.]

The talk before the series centered on Antetokounmpo, but if Toronto wants to get to the N.B.A. finals, a key element could be finding a way to handle Lopez, even if that means sitting one of its solid big men in favor of a smaller, faster lineup to try to run him off the floor.

Lopez’s career path has been anything but straight. Now in his 11th season, the slow-footed center was once written off as an effective scorer in the paint who offered little other value to the Nets, who took him out of the Stanford with the 10th overall pick in the 2008 draft.

He couldn’t rebound despite being 7 feet tall, he routinely had poor ratings in advanced defensive statistics, and he was not exactly stretching the floor. Over his first eight seasons the average distance on his field-goal attempts was just 7.5 feet, according to Basketball Reference’s play-by-play data.","If Brook Lopez Seemed to Be Everywhere, It’s Because He Was"
107,SPORTS,"This game always promised to be a high-scoring one. Erik Swanson and Michael Pineda entered the evening with a combined ERA of over 10.00. The Mariners were fresh off of a two-game sweep of the A’s in which they did not look lost. The Twins were fresh off of scoring eight runs against the Angels.

That the first two innings were scoreless, then, was something of a surprise. Each starter did a fine job of working the edges of the zone. It was an encouraging sign for Swanson, if not for the Mariner offense.

As Erik Swanson walked onto the mound to begin the fourth, maybe he looked around. He saw the paltry crowd and gloomy weather. The Terrace Park, Ohio native glanced into the crowd and saw uninterested faces. Maybe he was transported back to his tee-ball days. Suddenly he was seeing brown Ohio lawns and re-heated chili dogs. He was seeing old folks in the front rows trying to make it seem like they were having a good time.

He snapped back to reality, and he knew what he had to do.

After the fourth such tee shot, Swanson snapped back into reality. As he looked around he began to feel a sense of creeping horror as the consequences of his actions became apparent.

The score was 8-1, yes, but things were much graver than that. It appeared Swanson had transported T-Mobile Park into some bizarre 90’s-Ohio-themed pseudo-hell. Beefy white men were teeing off on clearly inferior opponents. The sky had turned an odd shade of orange. The worst part, though, was the cheese. There was so much cheese everywhere.

“What did I do to deserve this?” cried one poor man as he was showered in botulism-ridden cow curry. “I’ve never even been to Ohio!”

Such is the danger of notalgia, Erik Swanson learned tonight. Scott Servais walked out to retrieve Swanson in the fourth inning, but the damage had been done. Swanson had entertained his Midwestern nightmare, and we were all along for the ride.

In true Midwest fashion, however, the Twins had quickly overindulged and were left bloated and impotent from their offense outburst. Belts bursting, they managed just two runs against the four relievers the Mariners used to mop up the game.

Also in true Midwest fashion, the Twins felt kind of bad for beating up on the Mariners so badly. They did their best to apologize by giving up solo dingers to Ryon Healy and J.P. Crawford, as well as an extremely large dinger to our extremely large son.

By the time the dust settled, we were back to reality. Our cheese-covered Orpheus, sent to retrieve us from the underworld, had failed. But Vogelbach, our Hercules, rescued us. Though the Mariners still lost, they were saved from a far worse fate: remaining in the Midwest.","Mariners play baseball, Twins play teeball, baseball shown to be harder than teeball"
108,SPORTS,"For the Jets’ sake, they better hope their post-draft front office shakeup works out at least as well as the last time an AFC East team went this route. Buffalo in 2017 canned Whaley on April 30, right after he ran their draft, and hired the well-respected Beane away from Carolina just nine days later.

Granted, Buffalo isn’t on anyone’s short list of Super Bowl contenders, but it did end its tortuous 17-season playoff drought in Beane and McDermott’s first season in 2017, and despite the regression of last year the Bills are seen as an on-the-right-track team that is rebuilding its roster wisely and finally has a firm footing and foundation in terms of both coaching and the front office. Buffalo’s ownership has also been a strength under Terry and Kim Pegula, a description you can’t quite apply with a straight face to the Jets or Dolphins under the Woody/Christopher Johnson or Stephen Ross regimes.

To no surprise, Jets CEO and chairman Christopher Johnson maintains his team’s general manager job is a plum assignment and will attract great candidates. But the reality is, most franchises let their GMs hire their own coaches and the Jets have reconfigured that process once again, as they did in 2013, when they hired John Idzik as general manager with the provision that he keep Rex Ryan on as head coach. (How’d that work out for you, New York?) Maccagnan and Bowles were hired almost simultaneously in January 2015, and had something of a shotgun marriage given they had no prior experience together.

Of course, if the coach and new general manager already have a solid working relationship, as Gase and Douglas apparently do, then perhaps the Jets can make these hires out of order and still succeed. Again, that’s the blueprint the Bills followed two years ago, hiring Beane months after McDermott, but knowing that the pair successfully worked together for years in the Panthers organization.

And if you’re wondering, while some have speculated that longtime Patriots personnel executive Scott Pioli might have resigned as the Falcons assistant general manager on Thursday in order to pursue the Jets GM vacancy — imagine how that hire would go over in Foxboro? — I wouldn’t bet on it. Pioli’s departure from Atlanta has been a long time coming, and I’d be shocked if he decided to climb back into the top football leadership post of an AFC East franchise, especially one that wears green and white. I’d imagine there are about 27 other NFL general manager gigs he’d find more attractive and be enthusiastic about, so careful if you want to go connecting those dots.

Whomever the Jets hire as GM, Gase is suddenly in a comparative position of strength, having four months of seniority on the newcomer. We’re not sure what Gase ever did to deserve such power being bestowed, and there are those who still wonder if he’s got the goods as a coach, or was merely fortunate to have Peyton Manning to work with in Denver for three seasons. But whatever the truth may be, the reality is Gase now must deliver, especially if the Jets hire Douglas, giving him his top choice as general manager. He’ll be the master of his domain and he’ll own all that comes with it. But now comes the hard part.

Change at the top is nothing new in most parts of the AFC East, and New York just took its turn once again in starting over. As has always been the case, on-field success from the Jets, Bills and Dolphins is the only thing that will keep history from repeating itself.",Change at the top is the only constant in the non-Patriots portion of the AFC East
109,SPORTS,"Massimiliano Allegri

 Juventus supporters hurled eggs at his car when Allegri arrived to take his first training session in 2014 just six months after he was sacked by AC Milan. When he drives away from Juve for the final time at the end of this month, he will do so with five Serie A and four Coppa Italia winner’s medals.

The last Scudetto was wrapped up four weeks ago, over a month from the end of the season. But still his final term with Juve is seen as a disappointment. This is the first campaign under his watch they haven’t completed the domestic Double and, crucially, they still haven’t won the Champions League since 1996.

Allegri took them bloody close. In 2015 they lost to Barcelona in the final, while two years later brought defeat in Cardiff to Real Madrid. Signing Real’s best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, was viewed as one last throw of the dice, but when Ajax’s number came up instead in the quarter-finals, Juve’s season was over and so too, it was speculated, was Allegri’s reign.

Did he jump or was he pushed? Allegri said exactly a month before the statement confirming his departure: “I already talked with the president, I will remain at Juve next season and we are already planning the next campaign.”

Even if he was nudged towards the exit door, Allegri’s record is such that he will have no problem finding work. He can sit back and wait for a top job to come to him…

Antonio Conte

 Juve presumably felt it was time to go in a different direction – or rather back down a familiar road, if reports around Conte are to be believed.

The former Chelsea boss has been out of work after being axed by Roman Abramovich last summer when the Blues’ players’ notoriously short attention span was overdue a kickstart. In two seasons at Stamford Bridge, Conte won the Premier League title in his first year and the FA Cup in his second campaign.

Those achievements and the football world’s familiarity with the unforgiving working conditions at Chelsea have allowed Conte to take a year off and wait for a suitable offer. Now, though, the 49-year-old is ready to get back to work.

He is ’90 per cent certain’ of being back in management by the start of next season, while saying: “There is a 60 per cent chance that I’ll stay in Italy.” AC Milan, Inter and Roma are all said to be sniffing around Conte, but Juve also fancy bringing back their former captain and manager for another stint.

Conte at least can tell Juve he knows how to beat Ajax on the way to winning the Champions League. He was in the side which beat the Dutchmen in the final on the most recent occasion they lifted the European Cup in 1996.

Jose Mourinho

 Despite his reputation being in tatters in the Premier League after unceremonious exits from Chelsea and Manchester United, Mourinho is in a similar position to Conte. The Portuguese coach can still be choosy on the continent – hence why he has turned down ‘three or four offers’, with one said to be from Benfica – but he is getting restless on the sidelines.

Jose wants a club to tap him in: “I want to train a club, I want to find a place for this summer, in June for the pre-season.”

Most of the jobs seem to be coming up in Italy, where Mourinho drove Inter to the Treble in addition to his first Serie A title in 2009.

Bayern Munich have also been mentioned as a possible destination, which would certainly fit Mourinho’s agenda if the PSG job isn’t up for grabs: “I would like to win a third Champions League with a third club and to win a fifth league in a fifth different country.”

Michael Ballack reckons Jose would “bring a certain glamour” to Bayern and the Bundesliga. “With a coach like Mourinho, it’s probably easier for a club to get top stars,” he added, presumably forgetting everything about Mourinho’s last two years.

The former Arsenal manager may be approaching his 70th birthday but there is plenty of talk – or wishful thinking, at least – that the Frenchman still has one last job left in him.

That won’t be at Fulham, who have reportedly twice approached Wenger this season and both times they have been turned down. He’s not that desperate…

Wenger seems to have enjoyed his first year away from the game after a 22-year stint at Arsenal ended this time last year and, having left all the grief behind, a full-time coaching role may no longer be to his taste.

So talk of offers from Lyon and PSG of a general manager role may be more to Wenger’s liking.

Laurent Blanc

 The former France star has always said he will wait for the right job but how long does any manager have to be out of the game before they become irrelevant?

Blanc has been out of full-time work for three seasons after leaving PSG in 2016. It not like he needs the money. Apparently, he took a €22million pay-off from his last gig after leaving “a significant mark on the great history of Paris Saint-Germain”.

The 53-year-old also has success with Bordeaux on his CV and his two years in charge of the France national team are viewed in a positive light given the absolute chaos he inherited from Raymond Domenech.

The former Manchester United defender was linked with the caretaker role at Old Trafford in the hours of confusion between Mourinho’s sacking and the emergence of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as a temporary replacement. This summer, he has been linked with Roma, Lyon and Celtic. Those offers are unlikely to get any grander if he insists on continuing to play a waiting game.",The five best available managers and their records...
110,SPORTS,"While they are obviously different players who play different positions, there are definitely more than a few parallels between Jamie Collins and Patrick Chung. While they were both second round picks who had a lot of potential coming in, Collins had three very productive years with the Patriots, one of which ended in a second-team All-Pro nomination and a Pro Bowl berth. Chung, on the other hand, was not very good the first time around with the team.

The team, and fan base, however, had soured on both before they left the team the first time. That is something they most definitely have in common. The question I can’t get out of my head is: Why bring Collins back at this point? The most logical explanation is one that brings us back to Chung’s situation.

Cut with two years left on his deal with the Eagles, the Patriots decided to bring Chung back on a one-year deal. Keep in mind, he was only gone for one season. But in that year, the Patriots figured something out. Instead of using him as a prototypical safety, they needed to move him into the box and around the formation. Chung has turned into a master and covering tight ends, and has become an incredibly important part of the defense.

Why is this relevant? I think the Patriots are going to do something similar with Collins. Think about it, he was traded from the Patriots around reports that he was “freelancing” and not doing what he was supposed to be on defense. What if the coaching and scouting staff figured something out while watching him in Cleveland? That certainly would explain why Collins is back with the Patriots.

Collins was also cut with two years left on his deal. He had signed a 4 year, $50M contract with the Browns, and they decided, since the guaranteed money was gone, they didn’t want to pay his $10.5M salary this year. The Patriots certainly took their time making it official, but bringing him back should be a clear message: They think this time will be different.

The only reason to think that is because they have figured out exactly how he fits in. Maybe he’s not a prototypical linebacker, and they are going to be playing him in specific situations. Whatever they have planned, you should be excited. When is the last time the Patriots had so much talent and athleticism on defense? They’re going to be a fun team to watch, and something tells me Collins is going to play a role in that.

113,SPORTS,"Four months after she requested out from the Dallas Wings, Liz Cambage was traded to the Las Vegas Aces. The deal will send Moriah Jefferson, Isabelle Harrison, and 2020 first- and second-round picks to Dallas. Cambage, the WNBA’s leading scorer and MVP runner-up a year ago, immediately makes Las Vegas a championship contender.

Cambage’s inevitable trade lingered for months, with fans wondering if she’d play at all during the 2019 season. Cambage had her eyes set on the Los Angeles Sparks at the time of her request, but the 6’8 center is happy to play in Las Vegas, her agent, Alison Galer, told SB Nation. Cambage will report to the team prior to the May 26 season opener and is expected to start the season on time.

Though the Aces won out, the Sparks were in contention for Cambage’s talents up and through the final weeks before she was dealt to Vegas. Even after the Sparks made a separate trade for all-star big Chiney Ogwumike on April 27, they aimed to acquire Cambage, too, league sources told SB Nation.

Instead, Cambage will head to Vegas with a chance at competing for a title.

The Aces are now stacked with back-to-back-to-back No. 1 picks and the league’s most dynamic scorer, Cambage, who set a WNBA record with 53 points in a 40-minute game last season. Kelsey Plum, 2017’s top pick and the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer, will play guard with 2019 No. 1 pick and do-it-all complement Jackie Young. All-star Kayla McBride is a knockdown shooter on the wing, and Rookie of the Year A’ja Wilson will join Cambage down low.

In just their second season since relocating from San Antonio, the Aces are about to be the league’s biggest bandwagon franchise.

The WNBA has rarely featured significant star player movement due to its current team-friendly CBA. Teams are awarded a “core” provision, which is essentially a franchise tag that forces a player into signing with her current team, and it can be applied four times. Players can reach 30 years old before having their first unrestricted free agency, providing little offseason drama for fans and an unreasonable wait time for superstars to go play where they want.

But this summer has featured two stars relocating, with Ogwumike forcing her way from the Connecticut Sun to reunite with her sister in LA, and now Cambage doing the same to land in Vegas. Though Sun and Wings fans may not be happy, their moves are net positives for the league and will provide a more competitive and spicy postseason.

It’s important for the league in particular that Cambage ended up in Vegas. Green-lighting the franchise’s relocation from stable San Antonio to a city without another pro basketball team was a gamble. But now, Las Vegas is stacked with two of the WNBA’s most recognizable superstars in Cambage and Wilson, as well as a fleet of top picks. The WNBA couldn’t have asked for better tools to capture the interest of a fresh basketball market, both on and off the court.

Replacing Cambage’s talent was never feasible after she requested out. She’s arguably the best player in the world, and certainly no worse than third alongside Seattle’s Breanna Stewart and Washington’s Elena Delle Donne.

But Dallas had at least one better and less risky deal on the table. According to High Post Hoops’ Howard Megdal, the Sparks offered Dallas 2018 first-round pick Maria Vadeeva, their 2019 No. 7 pick (which ultimately became Kalani Brown), and a 2020 first-round pick prior to the WNBA Draft. Instead, the Wings made a move with Vegas for two players who were injured last season and low-round picks.

Jefferson, a former UConn standout, was the No. 2 pick in the 2016 WNBA Draft, but injuries have hampered the beginning of her career. She was stellar as an all-rookie team member in 2016, but missed 13 games in 2017 to a right knee injury that ultimately required season-ending surgery. She missed the first 17 games rehabbing in 2018, and only averaged five points and two assists in 16 minutes per game for the Aces upon returning. She still isn’t herself, and Dallas Wings CEO Greg Bibb said she may even sit out the 2019 season.

“While Moriah may ultimately decide to sit out the 2019 season, we are willing to wait for her first appearance in a Wings uniform. We believe she is an elite-level point guard and we are excited for her to join her hometown team and to be a key part of our organization for the foreseeable future,” Bibb said in the press release announcing the trade.

Harrison is a 6’3 center who took a personal medical leave of absence in the 2018 season, but had a solid 2017 showing, averaging 11 points on 50 percent shooting and six rebounds during the franchise’s final season in San Antonio. She’s solid, but she’s no Cambage.

The Wings do have plenty of young talent to develop. The group, which includes 2019 No. 5 pick Arike Ogunbowale, 2018 No. 6 pick Azura Stevens, and 2017 No. 4 pick Allisha Gray, is a coveted core which will only improve when all-star Skylar Diggins-Smith returns from the birth of her son.

But the talent received from the Cambage trade has a lot of question marks and a ceiling way lower than what Cambage brought, or even what the Sparks were prepared to provide.",Why Liz Cambage’s trade to the Aces is incredible for the WNBA
114,SPORTS,"News out of the NFL is that Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson is being suspended for the first six games of the season for a violation of the NFL’s performance-enhancing drug policy. This doesn’t change the fact Peterson is still among the elite of NFL cornerbacks.

But to respond to the litany of questions about the Pittsburgh Steelers making a trade for Peterson now, the answer has to be no. And understand this is coming from a point of view where I have advocated for the Steelers to trade for Peterson when it was first rumored he’d be on the market.

However, this suspension changes things a great deal. Pittsburgh is working hard to create a team void of drama. Adding Peterson might give Pittsburgh a talented player but the front office has made it clear talent doesn’t trump character at this point.

Additionally, while the salary paid to Peterson might be less because of the suspension, his cap hit would still be around $11 million. The Steelers have done plenty to upgrade the cornerback spot with Steven Nelson and Justin Layne. Someone else can take the risk on Peterson.",Now is not the time for the Steelers to trade for CB Patrick Peterson

They wondered whether Danny Ainge, Wyc Grousbeck, Brad Stevens or the players and fans want Irving back next season.

“If he’s off the team next year, they’re not nearly as talented on paper but maybe they’ll get along a little bit better,” Keefe continued.

Keefe also referred to Grousbeck's recent comments about Irving and his past comments about other players as evidence that he is not necessarily an Irving fan.",Keefe on Kyrie Irving: ‘No way Brad Stevens wants him back’

119,SPORTS,"NEW YORK — The job is Gio Urshela’s to lose.

But what if he can’t keep this up? The Yankees might have to look elsewhere.

With Miguel Andujar done for the season thanks to impending surgery to repair a partially torn right shoulder labrum, Urshela will be manager Aaron Boone’s everyday third baseman.

In 33 games, he's hit .330 with two homers and 15 RBI. And he’s displayed his usual brand of terrific defense.

The Yankees have every reason to think Urshela’s progress will continue. If it doesn’t, though, general manager Brian Cashman may want to look externally for help, especially if they don’t want to dedicate D.J. LeMahieu to strictly third base.

Here are three options:

Why: Cabrera, 33, has a long track record at the plate. The former shortstop has become a full-time third baseman and has also played second base. Cabrera is making just $3.5 million this year on a one-year deal.

Why: Cashman praised the switch-hitting Walker profusely at the end of last season, lauding him as a professional and great teammate. Helps that he took well to third base when asked to play there occasionally and he’d bring another left-handed bat into the lineup as a switch-hitter.

Why: Thumbs down time — again? Frazier was solid if unspectacular in his 66 games with the Yankees in 2017, though he definitely brought a fun dynamic to the clubhouse. But back to baseball: Frazier would give the Yankees coverage at first base and at third base, his primary position. Frazier is a fine defender and he’s making $9 million in 2019. He’s a free agent in the offseason. He hasn’t hit much this season and that’s alarming but he’s always had pop and emergency replacements are never perfect.

120,SPORTS,"INDIANAPOLIS – Sometimes, the best way to tell if things are going well is to watch how drivers talk with their hands when they’re out of the car.

If the gestures are calm and steady, things are fine. But if there’s a lot of wild air steering, be assured that things are troublesome. Thursday’s Indianapolis 500 practice session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was clearly in the latter category.

“You could see the gestures of a lot of people when they were debriefing with their engineers,” Sebastien Bourdais said after a rain-shortened session in which teams and drivers struggled to get a handle on changing weather conditions. “I don’t think there were a lot of people who thought it was easy. You could see a lot this and that (sideways gestures) and not a lot of straightforward.”

Temperatures continued their steady climb Thursday as qualifications approach for the 103rd Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge. As a result, drivers struggled to find grip and speed. Ed Jones recorded the fastest time Thursday at 227.843 mph, but it was more than 0.3 of a second slower than Will Power’s time from a leading lap of 229.745 mph during Tuesday’s opening practice.

The day featured the third crash in three days – a meeting with the Turn 2 SAFER Barrier and near-flip from which Carlin’s Patricio O’Ward escaped without injury – and plenty of teams fighting to maintain pace as temperatures moved past 80 degrees and humidity increased.

“When you see heads moving a lot and guys counter-steering and not acting comfortable in the car, you can definitely tell that today was quite a bit trickier,” said Bourdais, who had the fourth-fastest lap of the day at 225.996 mph in the No. 18 SealMaster Honda for Dale Coyne Racing with Vasser-Sullivan.

Other drivers near the top of the speed chart Thursday included 2017 Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato, who managed a lap of 226.699 mph, good for second fastest in the No. 30 Mi-Jack/Panasonic Honda; Zach Veach, who clocked in third fastest at 226.070 mph in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda; and rookie Colton Herta, who was fifth quickest at 225.458 mph in the No. 88 GESS Capstone Honda.

Jones, driving the No. 63 Ed Carpenter Racing Scuderia Corsa Chevrolet, credited team owner/driver Carpenter, who has won the pole at Indy three times and finished second last year, for the speed.

“With other teams, the third car might not be up there with the two main ones,” Jones said. “I’m grateful for that and looking forward to how the rest of the week progresses.”

Fernando Alonso, who crashed during practice Wednesday, didn’t return to the track Thursday after McLaren Racing engineers discovered the engine had been damaged and needed to be replaced in the backup No. 66 Chevrolet being prepared by his crew.

“While we have a number of experienced individuals in the team, we are still relatively new as a crew,” said Gil de Ferran, McLaren Racing’s sporting director and the 2003 Indy 500 winner. “Because of this and the fact that we have deep respect for Indianapolis, we are being careful and measured in our approach and want to ensure we’re sending the best possible car out on track.

“Not running today was a serious setback to our Indy 500 program, but all is not lost. We should have a full day of practice and preparations for qualifying tomorrow and our goal will be to have a nice, clean day.”

Teams will receive extra turbocharger boost for Fast Friday practice equivalent to about 50 added horsepower. That will remain in effect through the qualifying weekend. The temperature is expected to top out Friday in the mid-80s. INDYCAR Pass on NBC Sports Gold’s coverage begins at 11 a.m. ET.

“It looks like temperatures are rising anyway for this weekend, and it doesn’t really look like it’s going to be very cool for the 500, either,” Bourdais said. “We might as well get used to it. It’s a significant difference between low 70 degrees and overcast to mid-80s and some sun. And if the wind comes into play, that’s another factor.”

In Saturday’s first day of qualifying, drivers will compete for one of 30 locked-in starting positions and a spot in Sunday’s Fast Nine Shootout, which determines the starting order for the first three rows for the May 26 race. INDYCAR Pass live coverage begins with practice sessions at 8 a.m. Qualifying attempts are scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., with NBCSN taking over the coverage at 5 p.m.

Sunday’s qualifying has the Last Row Shootout for the final three grid spots and the Fast Nine Shootout, with NBC airing it all live starting at noon. NBCSN takes over at 3 p.m. to telecast an expected lively practice for the 33 qualifiers.",Search for speed continues at Indy 500 practice in trickier conditions
121,SPORTS,"NEW YORK -- Since April 1, one team has stood alone atop the American League East standings.

It might not after this weekend.

Many around baseball thought the switch might have happened last weekend, when the division-leading Tampa Bay Rays played host to the hobbled but surprisingly surging New York Yankees in a pivotal early-season series at Tropicana Field.

But the Rays managed to scratch out one win in those three games -- and still led the AL East on Monday.

Now, five days later, the teams meet again for another three-game set, this time at Yankee Stadium. The Rays enter this series with a half-game lead threatened by a Bronx Bombers club that has battled through a bevy of injuries and bludgeoned its way up the standings.

In looking ahead to the weekend, it's worthwhile to look back at the last time these teams faced off. Here are four things the Yankees have learned about the Rays.

The Rays' rotation primarily hinges on two of the arms the Yankees will face this weekend: those of Charlie Morton and defending Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell.

The Yankees have gotten to both of them in the past. In Sunday's 7-1 series finale win, the Bombers ultimately cruised to the lopsided victory thanks to timely post-power-outage pop against Tampa Bay's bullpen after the unexpected 43-minute delay. Although Snell was handed his fourth loss of the season, he allowed just two earned runs and four hits. With his breaking pitches working, he also struck out 12.

Still, his stuff against the Yankees hasn't always been so sharp: Snell is 3-5 with a 4.25 ERA and eight home runs allowed in 12 career starts versus the team he's faced more than any other.

Morton has squared off with the Yankees just four times in his 12-year career. While he has a 2-1 record against them, his ERA in those starts is 4.10. In his latest outing against the Yankees, late last May in the Bronx, Morton -- pitching for Houston at the time -- gave up eight hits and two home runs in an eventual Yankees win.

Before their collapse Sunday, the Rays' bullpen lost last Friday's series opener. Specifically, that game was decided in the sixth when reliever Emilio Pagan gave up a two-strike RBI single to Gio Urshela. The go-ahead drive effectively negated the nine-strikeout performance Tyler Glasnow had delivered before a forearm injury took him out of the game and ultimately landed him on the injured list.

As for Urshela, the third baseman who has replaced Miguel Andujar (lost for the year with a torn labrum), his month-plus tenure in the big leagues this season has been stellar. Key two-strike hits and run-producing drives are becoming as much a part of his game as the slick barehanded grabs he's had charging in from third.

As formidable as parts of this Rays staff might be, the Yankees learned last weekend they can navigate it.

2. The Rays aren't afraid to pitch aggressively -- just ask Luke Voit

Voit, the Yankees' hulking first baseman who has been a rather unexpected offensive godsend, has gotten a ton of pitches inside this season.

He's gotten so many that he's started taking exception to them. If you were hit five times in 42 games, you probably wouldn't be too happy either. ""It's frustrating,"" Voit said after getting plunked last Saturday at Tampa Bay.

Voit was most frustrated that the pitch Rays reliever Yonny Chirinos blasted him with was up and inside. It also came just two pitches after DJ LeMahieu took Chirinos deep. ""He can hit me anywhere else. This one's up and in,"" Voit said. ""It's a situation that can be career-ending. He's a sinkerballer and that was pretty straight."" The HBP resulted in a lot of barking between the teams, including from Yankees starter CC Sabathia, who was ejected his previous trip to Tampa Bay and later suspended for five games. In that September 2018 appearance, he hit then-Rays catcher Jesus Sucre after his own catcher, Austin Romine, had a pitch thrown behind him. ""It's just the same thing, you hit a home run and then they throw up and in,"" Sabathia said. ""It's stupid."" Regardless of intent as it pertains to Voit, the burly right-handed hitter has to expect more pitches to come in on his hands after the power he's shown in pinstripes (24 homers, 65 RBIs and a .955 OPS in 80 games as a Yankee entering Friday). And if any team is going to throw them, it'll be Tampa Bay. According to ESPN Stats & Information, 38.3 percent of the 47 pitches Voit has faced from Rays pitchers this season have been either balls too far in or strikes on the inside corner. Only the Giants have topped them, with 43.5 percent of the 62 pitches they tossed to Voit in a three-game series last month being inside. Overall, the power hitter has seen a slight uptick in the percentage of inside pitches he's seen in 2019 compared with 2018, when he was a relative unknown. Of the 679 pitches Voit saw in 2018, 28.8 percent were inside. Of the 693 he's seen so far this season, 32.8 percent have been inside. 3. Bombs away: The Rays have a little pop Tampa Bay might not be living by the long ball quite like the Yankees -- who set a major league single-season record with 267 homers last season -- but the Rays are having more success going deep than they did a year ago. Perhaps that helps explain the Rays' plus-62 run differential, the second-highest mark in baseball behind Houston's plus-87. ESPN's Buster Olney leads the discussion of the latest news and notes around baseball with the game's top analysts. Listen Yes, there are teams with nearly twice as many home runs as the Rays. Heck, even the Yankees' 62 homers, coming in a year in which many of their top sluggers are on the shelf, dwarfs the 49 Tampa Bay has. But a quarter of the way through the season, it's noteworthy that the Rays have already hit about a third of the homers they did a year ago. It's notable, too, that of their 49 homers, six came in last weekend's three-game series with the Yankees. In the middle game of that series, Tampa Bay went yard three times in a 7-2 win. First it was Avisail Garcia in the second inning, then in the next inning Yandy Diaz, who added another blast in the eighth. Diaz, who'd hit one homer in his first two big league seasons, already has nine in Year 3. Will he add to his total this weekend? Diaz left Wednesday's game in Miami due to a sore left ankle -- and it remains unclear whether he will play Friday night. 4. The Yankees' injuries haven't erased the stark differences between the franchises By the middle of next month, the Yankees will have met the Rays nine times across a 37-game stretch. That means these teams soon will be very familiar with each other, if they aren't already. It also means that even if the Yankees end up snatching first place from their division foes sometime this weekend, by the middle of next month the Rays could grab it right back. Perhaps, then, the best way to view this series is how Yankees manager Aaron Boone approached the last one. ""I don't really see it as where we stack up at this point or anything like that,"" he said a week ago. ""We're trying to rack up as many wins as we can. We're trying to play as well as we can. That's the hyper-focus we go into each day with."" With a comparable number of wins, Kevin Cash's Rays have clearly been trying to stockpile victories, too. And they're doing it with a payroll that's a mere fraction of the Yankees' nearly $210 million total. Even with all their missing stars, just three Yankees players who appeared in Sunday's series finale -- Brett Gardner, Masahiro Tanaka and LeMahieu -- would account for about 67 percent of Tampa Bay's payroll. As depleted as the Yankees have been by the injury blitz they've endured -- 17 of their players have landed on the IL this season -- they still have been able to fund a talented and deep organization, while also paying for top-of-the-line facilities whose failing lights don't cause unnecessary delays. (Then again, they could use an outfield that can quickly drain monsoon-like rains, but we digress.) Power outages and facility incongruities aside, depth certainly has been the difference for the beat-up Yankees. It's exactly what has helped them earn the chance to get past the Rays this weekend, instead of getting buried early.",Four things the Yankees have learned about the Rays

After the game Steph said that Game 2 was the most fun he’s had playing against his brother, and even revealed the two did a bit of trash talking in the fourth quarter.

“This was like the coolest experience I think I’ve ever had playing against him,” Steph said. “We talked about the stage and he was amazing tonight. Every minute he was out there defensively he was a pest, made three big shots in the fourth quarter, very timely. For my parents I know we’ve talked about it the whole series and these last two games, it’s probably nerve wracking as heck for them, but it worked out perfectly tonight, he played well and we won.

“He tried to distract me at the free throw line in the fourth quarter and I knew how to go back at him but stay focused on what I needed to do. It’s just fun. I had to catch myself a couple of times cause I do want to go over and have a little small talk or whatever, but you gotta stay locked in.”

So what did Seth say to his big brother?

“He made the first (free throw), I told him that’s like 70 in a row,” Seth said postgame. “I tried to jinx him a little bit. He was like ‘alright, it’s going to be 72.’ He made them both, so he wasn’t fazed.”",Steph says brother Seth tried to distract him at free throw line in fourth quarter

125,SPORTS,"The 2019 Preakness Stakes will be a race unto itself when it goes to post at 6:48 p.m. ET on Saturday from Pimlico. With the top four horses to cross the finish line in the Kentucky Derby skipping the Preakness 2019, there's a unique opportunity for others to step up and take advantage. Leading the charge in the current 2019 Preakness Stakes odds are two horses who also competed two weeks ago at Churchill Downs. Bob Baffert's Improbable, who wound up fourth following the Kentucky Derby disqualification of Maximum Security, is the morning line favorite at 5-2 Preakness Stakes odds 2019. A win secures Baffert's record-breaking eighth Preakness title. Improbable is followed by War of Will, who's listed at 4-1 and took seventh at the Derby. Warrior's Charge, a late addition to the 2019 Preakness field, has moved from 30-1 opening odds a week ago all the way to 12-1. He'll be jockeyed by two-time Preakness winner Javier Castellano and drew the No. 3 post. There are plenty of 2019 Preakness contenders who could make noise at Pimlico in what should be a very entertaining race. Before you lock in any 2019 Preakness Stakes picks and predictions, listen to what horse racing legend Hammerin' Hank Goldberg has to say.

Goldberg knew who was going to win the Preakness the last two years before the race even happened. How? Decades of experience as one of the nation's top horse handicapping experts helps, but he also goes straight to the source.

Two years ago, he was all over Cloud Computing as a massive 14-1 underdog to win the Preakness after chatting up the horse's trainer, Chad Brown. When Goldberg learned Javier Castellano was getting off Gunnevera to ride Cloud Computing, the Hammer pounced, putting him on top of his exacta, trifecta, and superfecta bets. Cloud Computing beat Classic Empire in one of the most thrilling Triple Crown races ever -- if you wagered $50 on his Preakness Stakes picks that year, you would have won an earth-shattering $11,000.

Goldberg nailed Justify at last year's Preakness, too. In fact, he was all over that horse months before the future Triple Crown winner took the Kentucky Derby. Goldberg cashed the Pick 4, Pick 5 and Pick 6 at Pimlico last year, another massive payout for the second leg of the Triple Crown.

Goldberg has gotten the 2019 season off to a strong start by nailing the winning horse in the Pegasus World Cup. He also cashed the exacta at the Gotham Stakes, Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby, among others. Anyone who has followed Goldberg's lead is up big-time.

Now with the race at Pimlico approaching, Goldberg is releasing his 2019 Preakness Stakes picks over at SportsLine.

We can tell you he's high on Alwaysmining, a long shot at 8-1 Preakness odds. Alwaysmining is a local challenger, looking to become the ninth Maryland-bred horse to win the Preakness and the first in 36 years. The Kelly Rubley-trained colt will have the hometown crowd on his side and will make his first start at Pimlico.

No horse comes in hotter. In fact, Alwaysmining has won six races in a row, all at nearly Laurel Park. He's consistently posted fast times and also beat Win Win Win (15-1 Preakness odds) in the Heft Stakes last December. His major claim to fame is winning the Federico Tesio Stakes, a Preakness ""win and you're in"" qualifier, by a whopping 11 1/2 lengths over Trifor Gold. In that race a month ago, he ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:50.12. There's plenty of history at stake for Alwaysmining as well, as a victory would make Rubley the first female trainer to win the Preakness. ""He's won six races in a row. You have to respect that,"" Goldberg told SportsLine. ""He's a really talented horse.""

Another shocker: Goldberg is fading Improbable, the top Vegas favorite and highest Kentucky Derby finisher to run in the 2019 Preakness. In fact, Goldberg says Improbable barely hits the board.

Improbable was considered one of the top contenders in the Kentucky Derby, but was blocked in a crowded field, lost position and dropped out of contention. The Baffert-trained colt still finished fourth, but Goldberg says he's not worth the 3-1 premium you'll need to pay. ""Improbable is not a sure thing,"" Goldberg told SportsLine. ""If the conditions aren't right, forget about him.""

Goldberg is also all over another darkhorse to take down the 2019 Preakness Stakes. This horse has all the tools to put together a complete run, and if he hits as Goldberg expects, you could be looking at a colossal payout.

Kaiser lost control going through Turn 3, clouted the outside wall and, much like Pato O’Ward’s accident, nearly flipped over. After sliding on its side and nearly tipping over, the car landed on the ground right-side up, but showing signs of significant damage that cast a shadow over the Juncos team’s preparations for qualifying.

The 23-year-old Californian escaped injury, and wasn’t sure what happened to his unsponsored No. 32 Chevy.

“I’m fine,” he said. “Grateful for the technology and safety that’s built into these cars – that was a big hit; I felt it.

“The opening lap felt good, and I’m not really sure what happened, I just lost it in the middle of the corner. We’ll have to look at the data to see what happened. We’ve got to go back and see what our options are, but this is obviously not what you want to happen the day before qualifying. But we’re going to do everything we can to make this race.”

Immediately after the impact team owner Ricardo Juncos said that his first priority was confirming that Kaiser was OK, and then the team would turn its attention to what can be done to get back on track.

“We don’t know what happened,” he said. “First we want to make sure he’s OK. I don’t know at this point; it’s too recent. We know this can happen, but it’s very unfortunate. Everything looks OK on the data, so we don’t know what happened.

“First step is make sure he’s OK, then we’ll talk with the team and see what we can do [to fix to the car].”",Juncos dealt a new blow by heavy Kaiser crash
128,SPORTS,"Liverpool duo Alisson Becker and Roberto Firmino have been named in Brazil's Copa America squad - but there is no place for Fabinho.

La Selecao boss Tite has named his 23-man squad for the 45th Copa America, which gets underway in Brazil on June 14, with both Firmino and Alisson rewarded for their excellent seasons with the Reds.

However, Fabinho misses out with the Head Coach naming Allan, Fernandinho, Lucas Paqueta, Philippe Coutinho, Arthur and Casemiro as his six midfielders.

Fabinho is absent from the 23 despite a superb first season at Anfield that could yet end with a Champions League winners' medal when Jurgen Klopp's men face Tottenham in Madrid on June 1.

Tite's hosts get the Copa America underway against Bolivia on June 14 in Sao Paulo before a clash with Venezuela four days later in Fonte Nova.

Their group concludes with a meeting with Peru before the knockout stages begin in Belo Horizonte on July 2.

Reds forward Firmino is expected to contend for a starting spot up top with Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus, while goalkeeper Alisson is likely to be named ahead of Ederson and Cassio.

Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar is named while Everton attacker Richarlison also makes the cut.

It's been another productive campaign for Firmino, despite missing the last three games of the Premier League campaign with a groin injury.

The Reds' No.9 has netted 16 goals for Klopp's side and will be fit to face Spurs at the Wanda Metropolitano in the Spanish capital at the beginning of next month.

Meanwhile, Alisson has enjoyed a fantastic first year as a Liverpool player, winning the Premier League's Golden Glove award for 21 clean sheets.",Two Reds make cut Brazil's Copa America squad as key man misses out
129,SPORTS,"Israel Folau's status as the unrivaled star of Australian rugby wasn't enough to save his job in the wake of a social media post that condemned gay people and other so-called sinners to eternal damnation.

Rugby Australia on Friday terminated Folau's four-year contract, 10 days after an independent panel found the 30-year-old fullback guilty of a high-level breach of the players' code of conduct for his contentious post in mid-April.

Folau can appeal the decision but it appears, at least for now, that his career has gone down in flames. The saga also has thrown Australia's preparations for the Rugby World Cup into turmoil.

A self-described devout Christian, Folau said he was merely posting a passage from the bible and he refused to take down the online post. For rugby Australia, it boiled down to a contract issue.

""We want to stress that this outcome is a painful situation for the game,"" Rugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle told a news conference in Sydney, broadcast live on TV. ""... but Rugby Australia's position remains that Israel, through his actions, left us with no choice but to pursue a course of action resulting in today's outcome.""

The code of conduct charge sparked debate in Australia about freedom of speech and the right of players to express their beliefs. It also followed a warning Folau received from Rugby Australia last year over a social media post that drew criticism from some rugby followers, including a major sponsor of the game.

In February, Folau signed a contract extension to remain with the Sydney-based New South Wales Waratahs and Australian rugby until the end of 2022. He was set to play an important role in Australia's World Cup campaign, starting in September. Now he's likely to be looking abroad to continue his professional playing career.

Folau issued a statement Friday saying ""I am deeply saddened by today's decision to terminate my employment. He said he was considering his options.

""I believe it is my duty as a Christian to share God's word,"" he said. ""Upholding my religious beliefs should not prevent my ability to work or play for my club and country.""

Castle said the Rugby Australia contract outlined the expectations of professional players, although there has been speculation about inconsistencies regarding when certain clauses were inserted and that reportedly could form the basis of an appeal for Folau.

""Our clear message to all rugby fans today is that we need to stand by our values and the qualities of inclusion, integrity, discipline, respect and teamwork,"" Castle said.

Pride in Sport co-founder Andrew Purchas commended Rugby Australia for its decisive action.

""We know that statements of sporting figures can have a profound impact on our culture, as well as have great influence on the community — especially young people,"" he said. ""Homophobic and transphobic discrimination is not acceptable in sport and individuals — irrespective of their social or professional stature — will be held accountable for their words and actions.""

Folau has been the undisputed star in his 73 test matches for the Wallabies since he joined the rugby union ranks following professional contracts in Australian rules football and in rugby league, where he also represented Australia.

In his most recent Super Rugby match for the Sydney-based New South Wales Waratahs, Folau scored his 60th try, the most of any player in the tournament, breaking the record of former New Zealand winger Doug Howlett.

Folau told people in his church on the weekend that he'd had chances ""to potentially make the situation a little bit easier"" and he could have gone back to play the game but he refused to compromise on his beliefs.

Some players have openly supported Folau's right to express his beliefs, and there was speculation that other devoutly Christian players may walk out on their contracts in Australia.

""Thank you also to those who have spoken out in my defense, some of whom do not share my beliefs but have defended my right to express them,"" Folau said.

Castle said she'd been in touch with professional players and assured that Rugby Australia ""fully supports their right to their own beliefs and nothing that has happened changes that.""

""But when we're talking about inclusiveness in our game, we're talking about respecting differences as well,"" Castle said. ""When we say rugby is a game for all, we mean it.""",Australian rugby star sacked after homophobic social media post
130,SPORTS,"If you’re in Philadelphia, you know all about it. Hey, if you’re reading this you probably know all about it. Bryce Harper, the $330 million man, is not having a great start to his Phillies career. At least by his previous, lofty standards.



He’s still hitting for power and taking walks, it’s true. It looks like he’s improved his defense perhaps by going all out in the field. Overall, he’s an above-average player at the plate and in the field, and he’ll probably get right.



But you can’t help but notice that outsized strikeout rate.



Going into this season, Harper had struck out 21 percent of the time. He’s now striking out 30 percent of the time. This might already sound familiar — the rest of the league is striking out more than ever, too. And that’s not the only thing Harper has in common with the league.

131,SPORTS,"In what proved to be one of the most momentous nights of the 2019 Atlanta Braves season, Austin Riley hit his first big-league home run in his debut.

And on top of that, starter Mike Soroka dazzled over seven shutout innings as the Atlanta Braves beat the Cardinals.

It was a game of storybook elements coming from so many places, and the win lifted the Atlanta Braves back above .500 (22-21) and to within 2.5 games of first place in the National League East.

The hype factor for Wednesday night’s contest against the St. Louis Cardinals was at fever pitch when it was announced that star prospect Austin Riley would be making his major league debut, and the kid didn’t disappoint.

His fourth-inning home run that was blasted into the outfield seats will be a moment that he, his teammates, and Braves fans won’t soon forget.

In case you missed it… AND WHY DID YOU?… here’s the video, courtesy of @FOX Sports/Braves on twitter:

This wasn’t cheap: A no-doubter deep into the Cobb County night! And after being lifted in the 8th inning for defensive replacement Charlie Culberson, the Braves didn’t lose anything on offense either as Culberson hit a 2-run dinger of his own.

Not to be upstaged by his teammate, Mike Soroka tamed one of the fiercest lineups in the National League over the course of seven scoreless innings.

It continues a remarkable streak for the Atlanta Braves right-hander, who is making a name for himself as one of the elite starters in the National League.

The Braves responded with authority following Tuesday night’s blowout loss, and will face off in the rubber match of the three-game series with St. Louis on Thursday night.

132,SPORTS,"It’s only the middle of May, but Bears fans can start celebrating their inevitable division title thanks to CBS Sports Analyst Jason La Canfora. Alright, that may be a slight exaggeration, but when it comes to La Canfora and his predictions, specifically for the Bears, it’s almost certain the complete opposite comes to fruition.

La Canfora unveiled his 2019 division winners and playoff teams list on Friday and when it came to the NFC North, he isn’t a big believer in Matt Nagy’s squad. In fact, he predicts the Bears will regress mightily, similar to the 2018 Jacksonville Jaguars after they barely missed out on a Super Bowl berth in 2017.

Below is La Canfora’s summary of the NFC North, where he picks the Minnesota Vikings to come out on top:

Minnesota. Kirk Cousins may not ever get them over the mountain, and he may not win huge games, but they will beat enough mediocre teams to win this division. They dealt with mental health and physical health issues on defense in 2018, but Mike Zimmer knows the bar must be set higher on that side of the ball this year, and I expect them to be more consistent and menacing. Give Cousins a few more leads and good things happen. I have serious concerns about the new power structure in Green Bay and the Aaron Rodgers/Matt Lafleur coupling could be perilous, and the Bears are the poster boys for 2019 regression to me (more on that next week).

It will be interesting to see his rationale come next week for the serious regression. The Bears did lose Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio this offseason and a couple key contributors on the defense in S Adrian Amos and slot CB Bryce Callahan, but the defensive core is intact and QB Mitchell Trubisky and the entire offense is expected to take a major step in year two of Nagy’s offense. Furthermore, Minnesota (and specifically Kirk Cousins) hasn’t shown the ability to win the big games in 2018. Is there reason to think that will change in 2019, even with the additions they made this offseason?

Finally, it’s well documented that La Canfora has missed on nearly every Bears-related prediction he’s made in recent memory:
• He reported the Bears would make trading for then-New England Patriots QB Jimmy Garoppolo their “offseason priority” in 2017.
• The Bears wanted to bring in then-ESPN NFL Broadcaster and former General Manager Bill Polian in 2016. to their front office.
• Kyle Fuller would not be re-signed by the Bears in 2018.
• The Bears were questioning Trubisky’s ability to be a franchise QB in early 2018.

Bears fans know not to put too much weight into La Canfora’s reports or predictions at this point, but it sounds like he’ll have more reasoning on why he doesn’t believe in the Monsters of the Midway.",Bears called 'poster boys for regression' in 2019
133,SPORTS,"There's no doubt that this week's series against the Brewers was a measuring stick for the Phillies and they came up short. After winning the opener, they were outscored 22-6 by a top-tier Milwaukee team that has one of the best lineups in baseball.

Phillies pitching struggled nearly every time through the Brewers' order Tuesday through Thursday. Christian Yelich hurt them. Ryan Braun killed them. Yasmani Grandal came up with runners in scoring position all week and made the Phils pay with a pair of three-run homers. Mike Moustakas had productive ABs. On Thursday, even Brewers pitcher Zach Davies got into the act with a double and an RBI bunt single.

The Phillies start another series with the Brewers a week from Friday. In between are three home games against the Rockies and four with the Cubs at Wrigley Field. This is a grueling stretch, the Phillies' toughest of the season.

And adjustments need to be made for them to maintain their lead on the rest of the NL East.

""Action steps have to come following a series like this,"" manager Gabe Kapler said, choosing not to expand until he had a longer look back at these four games. ""You can't just sit on your hands and hope it's going to get better for the next series.

""We have to play very good baseball to beat teams like Milwaukee, Colorado and Chicago. We don't have the margin for error, most teams don't, when you play the best teams in the league.""

This series highlighted a few things. It showed how much work the Phillies have to do to be a consistent, upper-echelon team. It showed how much better Yelich is than every hitter in the NL, including Bryce Harper. It showed that the Phillies, right now, just don't have enough players clicking at the plate.

""When we were really clicking or clicking better, as an offense, you'd get production from each part of the lineup — top, middle and end,"" Kapler said. ""Right now, we're not getting that.""

Kapler switched things up atop his order for the first time all season on Thursday, batting Harper second and Jean Segura third. It did work early. Segura homered in his first at-bat and drove in a run with a groundout in his second AB. Harper and Andrew McCutchen each reached base and scored a run in their second at-bats.

The benefit of that 1-2-3 is that McCutchen and Harper each reach base at an extremely high clip and Segura is money with runners in scoring position with his ability to hit a ball wherever it's pitched and use the whole field.

The hindrance of that 1-2-3 is that, when J.T. Realmuto starts, it gives the Phillies three right-handed hitters in a row batting 3-4-5. That would make things a bit easier for opposing managers late in games.

The Phillies couldn't muster nearly enough offense against a Brewers team that scored at least one run in seven of nine innings Thursday (see observations). Get past Yelich and you have to deal with Braun. Get past Braun and the powerful lefty Moustakas and switch-hitting Grandal are waiting.

Zach Eflin fared better against the Brew Crew than Aaron Nola, Jerad Eickhoff and Jake Arrieta, but not by much. Eflin allowed four runs in five innings, walking two, hitting a batter and striking out seven. He kept the Phillies in the game and the score close but the bullpen did not.

Eflin said the pitches that hurt him most were those intended to leak back over the outside or inside corner but instead caught too much plate. He has earned the benefit of the doubt by excelling in six of his nine starts and bouncing back in a strong way after his only clunker April 13 in Miami.

Now, the Phillies move on to the Rockies, who are well-rested after off-days Monday and Thursday but may not have Trevor Story, who bruised his knee Wednesday in Boston. The Rockies are 20-22 but have a dangerous lineup, one nearly as potent as the Brewers'.

""If you don't do your job, you're going to get your butt kicked,"" McCutchen said of the Brewers series and the tough games that await the Phillies. ""That's plain and simple. We can all agree here that we didn't play our best baseball and in return, we got our butt kicked. Nothing to cry over, we just have to show up and be ready to go tomorrow.""

134,SPORTS,"CHARLOTTE – The Panthers have filled the opening on their 90-man roster with Aldrick Robinson, an unrestricted free agent with a track record as a reliable complementary receiver.

""They want to stretch the field. They want me to add to that. They like my speed and my ability to open things up,"" Robinson said. ""I can create separation and get by defenders.""

Robinson, who has 86 career receptions for 1,422 yards and 14 touchdowns, signed a one-year contract. The 5-foot-10, 185-pounder scored five touchdowns last season for the Vikings, the fourth team he's scored for since the Redskins selected him in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft.

""My career has been a grind,"" Robinson said. ""I've always had to prove myself everywhere I've been. I'm OK with that.""

A speedster out of SMU, Robinson spent his rookie year on Washington's practice squad but has played in at least 14 games in five of the seven seasons since. He played just five games for Washington in 2014 and was out of football in 2015, but every other year since 2012 he's scored at least two touchdowns despite catching no more than 20 passes in any season.

135,SPORTS,"Stephen Curry and his younger brother Seth are taking their sibling rivalry from the backyard to the NBA playoff stage.

And according to Chris Strachan, a longtime family friend, “Seth really feels like he’s better than Steph. He’s always felt that way.”

The elder Curry brother’s Golden State Warriors will host the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals on Tuesday night.

“Steph was making everything,” Strachan recalled [having watched the brothers play 1-on-1 in the summer of 2013] on Monday. “Seth even blocked a couple of shots and they went in because he blocked them. Seth famously says, ‘Steph is the luckiest dude in the whole world.’ Seth really feels like he’s better than Steph. He’s always felt that way.” This is a big part of who they are, why they work so well together. Steph and Strachan have the same fervor rooting for Seth. And when Steph is on the court, Seth and Strachan root hard for Steph. “So many years I watched Steph playing in the Western Conference finals, the NBA Finals, being in the crowd,” Seth told reporters this week. “So it’s going to be fun to be out there on the court, competing to get to (the Finals).

137,SPORTS,"It's not the same anymore, and this no longer feels so strange. Once a realm of star players, big crowds and even better baseball, Comerica Park has felt more like an empty factory building for the better part of two years. Within time, the workforce will return and the machines will whir back to life.

But, right now, this is the inevitable reality of a rebuild, a rebuild that was inevitable in itself.

And so on Wednesday night with the Astros in town and Justin Verlander back on the mound, a sparse crowd shuffled through the gates and watched what it has come to expect. The Tigers went quietly, and the Astros swept a series in which they barely bent over. This used to be the other way around.

These days, singular voices stand out at Comerica Park. The air is far too still to drown them out. After mostly cruising through seven innings of one-run ball against his former team, Verlander laughed and said he kept hearing a heckler in left field.

""You suck!"" the heckler yelled again and again, and maybe he was just projecting on the situation at large. It'd be hard to blame him.

Otherwise, the fans cheered Verlander here and there, and Verlander acknowledged them a couple times by tipping his cap. He said it's ""really special"" to know he still occupies a place in their heart. But this wasn't like last year, when he returned for the first time and the emotions were still raw.

This was Verlander's introduction to the new reality in his old home.

""It’s kind of sad. Most of my memories here, this ballpark was packed and fans were rowdy,"" he said. ""This is obviously a bit different now, but that comes with winning. You put a winning product on the field and the fans show up. Nothing against these guys, I know they’re grinding and playing the best baseball they can, but it comes down to winning.""

If this was supposed to be a family reunion, most of the clan couldn't make it. Even Miguel Cabrera was scratched from the lineup with a sore knee. It would have been his first time facing his longtime teammate. When the two met up on the field Monday afternoon, big smiles splashed across their faces, Cabrera challenged Verlander to bring it on Wednesday.

""Oh, you know I'll bring it!"" Verlander replied.

It's too bad he never got the chance. Well, depends who you ask.

""No, no,"" Verlander said with a laugh. ""We talked about it a bunch when we played together. I don’t know what I would have done to him, I’ve seen him be such a prodigious hitter for so long. You have all these moments in your head that you just have flashbacks to and it’s like, alright, well, he’s hit that pitch, he’s hit that pitch, he’s hit that pitch.""

The only one to get Verlander on Wednesday was JaCoby Jones, who ran into a fastball and sent it over the left field fence in the third inning for one of Detroit's two hits on the night. Verlander walked off the mound a few innings later with another win in the bag, the 99th of his career at Comerica Park, his second for the road team.

Maybe, even if he can't admit it publicly, Verlander has plans to one day pitch again for the home team. And maybe that desire was stoked, just a little, after seeing what's become of the place where he grew up. Verlander was quick to respond when asked if he'd like to see the Tigers regrow into a contending bunch.

""Of course,"" he said. ""I still follow these guys, still watch all the guys I played with. I’m rooting for them, especially a few guys over there. (Matthew) Boyd, (Daniel) Norris, Miggy, Nick (Castellanos), the guys I played with for quite a few years. I think you always root for your friends. You’re not wishing ill will on anybody until I'm facing them. Other than that, I’m pulling for them.""

On Monday, Verlander said one of the biggest regrets of his career -- maybe the biggest -- was failing to win a World Series for Mike Ilitch. It's nothing he can change now, even if were ever to return. He struggled with that word -- regret -- Wednesday night. He can live with the failure because he knows he tried.

""Thinking back, regret, I gave everything I possibly had,"" Verlander said. ""It's one thing I look at and I’m disappointed about, but I don’t sit back and think of those moments and how we came so close. I did for a long time. But winning one, personally, kind of exorcises some of those demons and some of those memories. You remember one pitch here and there, that can dwell on you.

""But I’m definitely disappointed we weren’t able to pull it off here. Always will be.""

Who knows if he'll ever have the chance to change that. For what it's worth, he'll be a free agent in 2022, right around the time a certain rebuild should be coming to fruition, and he has plans to pitch until he's 45 years old. He turned 36 this winter.

Surely, it would bring Verlander joy to turn the lights back on this building.",Justin Verlander Saddened By New Reality At Comerica Park
138,SPORTS,"Former Olympic sprint legend Usain Bolt's bid to crack Paris's electric scooter ride-share market struggled out of the starting blocks this week amid a row over naming rights.

The athlete was in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday to launch his brand Bolt Mobility, which he co-founded, was an already crowded market for scooters, which users pick up and park anywhere in the city via a smartphone app.

But the tribunal de grande instance has ruled that his scooters cannot use the Bolt name, because a rival has already trademarked it, Le Figaro reported. In March, another company, Txfy - which operates VTCs and scooters in Paris - rebranded as Bolt.

That company lodged a legal complaint with the court, which ruled in its favour. As a result, Thursday's trumpeted app launch was postponed and 500 branded scooters had to be hastily rebranded 'B - by Usain Bolt'.

The app was expected to be available on Apple and Android operations in France on Friday, while the athlete attended the Vivatech expo in Paris to promote his company - and it's new nano e-car.

Paris is intended to be the launchpad for the Olympic champion's ride-share service in Europe. There are plans in place to offer scooters in 20 European cities by the end of 2020. The company may, however, find itself in a similar situation elsewhere - as the rival Bolt brand already operates in London, Stockholm, Lisbon and Prague and has registered the brand name in 54 markets.

Mr Bolt has not definitively given up on using his name to promote his escooters in France. ""We are going to ask that this case, dealt with in summary proceedings, be examined on its merits by the courts,"" said Didier Louvet, general manager of the company in France.

Revealed on the official Minecraft website, Minecraft Earth allows players to collect, explore, collaborate and survive while exploring and building new Minecraft creations in the real world. Like in the original Minecraft, which is celebrating it’s tenth anniversary, Minecraft Earth features old and new mobs, and over time players will discover new variants they can use to populate their builds. For example, you can find Minecraft pigs just hanging out in your neighborhood park.

Players can also explore their neighborhood to find blocks, then use any flat surface to build on. Using Build Plates, players can team up with friends to create and place them in the real world to explore at life size and leave for others to see. Players can craft new items, breed mobs, grow crops and more.

However, players will also encounter hostile mobs out in Minecraft Earth that they'll have to fight off. It’s unclear at this time exactly how Microsoft intends to moderate content put out into this AR world.

Minecraft Earth will be available on Android and iOS devices as a free-to-play title. Closed betas for the game will be available for players to participate in this summer, and fans can sign up here and get a free Earth skin. While there will almost definitely be micro transactions tied to Minecraft Earth, its FAQ clearly notes that it will not have loot boxes.

Minecraft’s biggest update, village & pillage, is available now and introduces Pillagers and their Beasts, over 10 new Villagers, a Crossbow and more.

143,TECHNOLOGY,"You can at last get incredible 5G phone speeds in the US today, according to our tests, but only in two cities and only if you do what we're calling 'the 5G shuffle.'

We were able to test the Verizon 5G network in Chicago using a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (and we'll stick around to keep doing so until Tuesday on our own), and we've been able to pull down consistent speeds topping 1Gbps. One of our 5G tests peaked at 1.385Gbps.

But to get these headline-worthy speeds, we had to basically move (or dance) around the 5G nodes that sit above lampposts on specific blocks in Chicago. It's reportedly the same in the only other US city with active Verizon 5G nodes, Minneapolis.

TechRadar became the first outlet with a 5G phone when the Moto Z3 5G launched last month, but the Verizon 5G network was just getting underway. It either wasn't as fast back then, or we didn't get consistent-enough signal to reach the heights we're seeing now. It even frequently dropped back down to 4G LTE mid-test.

Now, five weeks later and with the Galaxy S10 5G in hand, we've gotten speeds that made the Verizon engineers on hand from New York visibly excited. They're seeing the nearly 1.4Gbps speeds in the wild for the first time, too.

Speeds tests using the Ookla app offered us some insight into peak raw speeds, and they were great. But it was also important to do real-world tests – while doing the 5G shuffle – to see how Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Android game downloads did.

Yes, we waited on the same rainy street corner in Chicago to test these speeds. One finished in under a minute, and the other took one hour and 16 minutes.

The difference is staggering in this 5G test. We used the Galaxy S10 5G connected to Verizon's 5G ultra wideband signal. The 4G comparison test used an iPhone XS Max on AT&T's getting '5Ge' signal (which isn't actual 5G, as we've reported multiple times).

We were also able to download Fortnite in 2 minutes and 55 seconds and Asphalt 9: Legends in 2 minutes and 23 seconds on the Galaxy S10 5G.

While these 5G tests weren't at nearly 1.4Gbps, they were fast (around 1Gbps) and depended on if the app maker was optimized to deliver fast speeds. Downloading the game PUBG from the Google Play Store, for example, was a bit slower than downloading the same game file from the Galaxy App Store.

In other words, the pull from our 5G device and direct line of sight of the 5G node was important, but so is the push from Google, Netflix and other content providers.

We'll continue to update our week-long 5G test as we get more time the the Galaxy S10 5G and compare it to 4G LTE in Chicago.","Verizon's 5G speed peaks at 1.4Gbps, but only if you do 'the 5G shuffle'"
144,TECHNOLOGY,"Back in January, we wrote about Spotify’s upcoming in-car music player. The company’s in-car music player was leaked through its app, and it was expected to launch the device sometime later this year.

And now, Spotify is making things official. Well, kind of.

The company today announced its in-car music player, called the Car Thing. Yes, literally.

Spotify’s Car Thing device is an in-car music and podcast player that will let you connect the device directly to your car and control playback with your Spotify. you can simply say “Hey Spotify” and give commands to the device to control the playback.

The device isn’t being made available to everyone, though. Spotify is only doing the “test” with a simple group of Premium users in the US, and technical + pricing details about the device isn’t being revealed. “While we know there has been some speculation about our future plans, Car Thing was developed to help us learn more about how people listen to music and podcasts. Our focus remains on becoming the world’s number one audio platform—not on creating hardware,” the company says.

Spotify even said the company might do similar tests for the Voice Thing and Home Thing in the future, so that should be interesting too. At the end of the day, though, Spotify makes it very clear that the company has no “current plans” to make the Car Thing available to consumers and it’s only part of a test — so you might not get to buy the device for your own car anytime soon.",Spotify Starts Testing Its In-Car Music Player 'Car Thing'
145,TECHNOLOGY,"This is an awkward time to review the Google Pixel 3 XL, I know. So I’ll be brief: You should only consider purchasing Google’s current flagship right now if you can get it at a significant discount. There are more modern flagships since the release of the newer-generation Snapdragon 855. And Google is now selling a less expensive Pixel 3a XL that fixes many of the issues with this handset.

The good news? The Pixel 3 XL is often on sale, though I’ve never seen it as low as when I purchased it during the Google Fi half-off anniversary sale.

The Pixel 3 XL visually resembles previous Pixel handsets, with the same dual panel design on the rear. But the back is now all-glass, instead of aluminum, to belatedly enable wireless charging. And that means it is less durable than previous Pixels, and especially prone to cracking. I strongly recommend a case.

Which is a shame, really, because the Pixel 3 XL is a pretty handset from the rear, and has minimalist good looks. It comes in three colors—Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink—the latter of which is absolutely not pink; it’s more of a tan and I like it quite a bit.

From the front, however, the Pixel 3 XL is a buck-toothed monstrosity thanks to its comically large notch, which is about twice as tall the notch on any other smartphone. This required Google to make some weird design choices in software, so that the Android status bar (at the top) isn’t just cut in half and lacking any usable space, but it’s also twice as tall as on any other phone. It’s all just wasted space, for the most part.

Adding to the embarrassment, the Pixel 3 XL also features a noticeable lower bezel, or chin. And that makes no sense: One way that phone makers have justified notches is that using one eliminates the need for a lower bezel, creating an “all-screen” look with three bezel-less sides. Well, not with the Pixel 3 XL, folks.

If you can get past the monster notch, the Pixel 3 XL display is stunning, and it offers more usable onscreen real estate than its notch-less predecessor, the Pixel 2 XL. It’s a 6.3-inch HDR-enabled OLED display with a QHD+ (2960 x 1440) resolution at 523 ppi and with a tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio. It offers a stunningly bright 100,000:1 contrast ratio, 16.77 million colors, and dark, inky blacks.

This display is all the more impressive when you compare it to the bland, washed out Pixel 2 XL display I previously suffered with. But it doesn’t offer curved display edges like Samsung’s and Huawei’s flagships. That may be good or bad, depending on your preferences. But that, along with its Corning Gorilla Glass 5 coating should help protect it when dropped. (I still recommend a case, of course, since the back is all glass too.)

The Pixel 3 XL supports a nice ambient mode that displays the time, date, weather, and a few notifications. But the only issue I’ve had with the display is related to this issue: When the display turns off—that is, enables the ambient view—it often does so with a disconcerting and noticeable flash of light that seems … wrong. Researching this, I’ve found that I’m not alone—no surprise there, given Google’s history of hardware issues—but it’s not a huge problem. I hope.

From a specification perspective, the Pixel 3 XL was almost but not quite state of the art when it first shipped in late 2018. But looking at the phone here in May 2019, it’s fallen a bit further behind compared to more modern flagships. That doesn’t mean it won’t provide great performance for at least a few years. But it’s less future-proof than other, and more recent, flagships and that should factor into any purchase decision.

First up is its octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and Adreno 630 graphics, a potent combination, albeit one that has been supplanted this spring by the more powerful Snapdragon 855 and Adreno 640 graphics. These are aided and abetted by just 4 GB of RAM. This is, at best, adequate for day-to-day usage but feeble compared to most competitors. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S10 ships with 8 GB of RAM and last year’s OnePlus 6T provides 6 GB, 8 GB, or 10 GB of RAM depending on the model. Rounding out the core specs is 64 GB or 128 GB of storage, which is likewise adequate. Power users expect a 256 GB option, if not more.

So, what are we to make of this? I have my theories about Google’s inability to satisfy the needs of more sophisticated users, especially gamers, and these center around the smallness of its smartphone business and its inability to secure the friendlier components pricing that would be available if they shipped more volume. But less excusable is the fact that Google has aligned its phone release schedule to Apple’s and not to Qualcomm, its most important chipset provider. Qualcomm ships its fastest mobile processors every spring, so by the time Google gets around to shipping new Pixels in October, it’s at the end of that processor generation’s run. That’s just dumb on Google’s part.

Beyond those core specs, the Pixel 3 XL provides dual front-firing speakers, a smallish 3430 mAh battery, worldwide cellular network/carrier compatibility (GSM and CDMA), Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0 + LE, and NFC. That all looks good on paper. But I have a few issues.

While the speakers do provide deep, rich sound, that sound is negatively impacted by a tinny echo and vibration inside the handset’s body that I take to be related to its glass-based superstructure. As bad, the stereo is imbalanced and heavily biased to the right (bottom) speaker, which is hard to ignore. Perhaps related, I’ve had call quality issues for the first time in a long time. On my end, the Pixel 3 XL’s earpiece emits a staticky sound as soon as any call connects, and it stays like that for the duration of the call. But my wife also reported several times that my voice came through garbled, like an electronic version of Donald Duck, during calls. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s annoying.

And that battery is almost a crime against humanity: One of the first things I noticed when I switched to the Pixel 3 XL from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro was that the battery life I was getting went down dramatically. Well, I can see why: When you couple the Pixel 3 XL’s very large display with a high-end processor and a relatively small battery, your longevity is going to suffer. The Mate 20 Pro, by comparison, has a far bigger 4200 mAh battery. The Pixel should provide at least a 4000 mAh unit.

For all the issues the Pixel 3 XL has, its cameras are still among the most highly-rated in the industry, and with this particular handset, those accolades extend for the first time to the front cameras. And, yes, that’s cameras with an s: there are now two cameras on the front of the handset. Which is interesting, because Google is somehow still making do with just a single camera in the rear where most of its competitors have moved on to three- and even four-lens rear camera systems.

From a specifications perspective, the rear camera is a 12 MP single lens unit with a f/1.8 aperture, autofocus with dual pixel phase detection, and optical and electronic image stabilization. The dual front cameras include an 8 MP wide-angle lens with a f/2.2 aperture and an 8 MP normal lens with a f/1.8 aperture. The normal lens has a 75-degree field of view, but the wide-angle expands that to 97 degrees.

Here, too, the passage of time hasn’t helped Google’s cause. The Samsung Galaxy S10 family of handsets and the Huawei P30 Pro that I’m now testing too both have better-rated cameras, overall, than does the Pixel 3 XL. And the recently-announced OnePlus 7 Pro apparently trumps them all, at least from a photo (vs. selfie or video) perspective.

Put simply, other cameras offer photography features that exceed what you can do on Pixel. The iPhone continues to be the champ for panoramas, for example. The Samsung Galaxy S10’s version of portrait mode lets you modify the background bokeh blur both when you’re taking a shot and after the fact; with Pixel, you can either show the background blur or not, that’s it. And where other cameras have 2x, 3x, and even 5x optical zoom, the Pixel still makes do with basic (and blurry) digital zoom.

But the Pixel 3 XL does excel in one area that the others have yet to match, low-light photography. I still have never gotten results like those I see on Pixel in low-light, and they border on—no, exceed—magical. The Pixel camera’s Night Sight feature is simply unmatched.

The Pixel 3 XL also includes a super-wide selfie mode that is enabled by its dual front-facing cameras. So, you can basically turn it up to 11, if you will, by zooming past 100 percent. It’s a really cool effect, and it is truly useful.

Here’s where I stand on photography. In normal or ideal conditions, the Pixel 3 XL provides one of the very best camera experiences you can get in any flagship handset. What it lacks, if this is a problem for you, is that hyper-contrast and colorful HDR effect, which I now think of as fauxtography, that is so popular with the Instagram set. If that’s your thing, the recent Huaweis—the P30 Pro and Mate 20 Pro—are better choices. But almost no one would be disappointed by the Pixel 3 XL camera. It’s terrific overall.

Thanks in part to its integrated Titan M security chip, the Pixel 3 XL is among the most secure smartphones available today. Titan M enables some of the same hardware-based security functionality we enjoy today on modern Windows PCs, like Verified Boot (a secure boot process), and it powers security features like full-disk encryption and tamper protection during OS and firmware upgrades. The Pixel 3 XL is, of course, an Android Enterprise Recommended handset, and its Google Play Protect technologies provide always‑on app analysis, scanning, and (if needed) removal.

Practically speaking, your most obvious interaction with security will be with the Pixel 3 XL’s excellent and speedy rear-facing fingerprint reader. This is my preferred method for signing-in to a phone, as it’s faster than in-display fingerprint readers, more convenient than front-facing fingerprint readers, and far more secure than any Android-based facial recognition functionality. (Apple’s Face ID is excellent, but there’s nothing like it on Android.)

Google doesn’t push past the norm very much when it comes to unique hardware features. There’s a fingerprint reader on the rear, as noted above, but no facial recognition and no headphone jack.

That said, a unique feature called Active Edge lets you squeeze the bottom sides of the phone to summon Google Assistant. That seems goofy to me, and I leave it disabled. But even worse, you can’t configure this squeeze to launch other activities, like the camera.

The Pixel 3 XL also supports fast charging and, unlike Apple, Google has the class to ship an 18-watt fast charger in the box with the handset. The device allegedly also supports “fast wireless charging,” which I assume is fast only in the context of wireless charging, which is generally very slow.

The Pixel 3 XL ships with Google’s clean Android 9 Pie image, and it’s a delight, with no crapware or superfluous nonsense. It will also be supported by Google for some time to come: The firm promises three years of security updates and two years of Android version upgrades, so you’ll get both Android Q (late 2019) and Android R (late 2020). This is Android as it should be.

The Google Pixel 3 XL starts at $899 for a 64 GB model and you can upgrade to a 128 GB GB model that costs $999. In the United States, the phone is available from the Google Store or from Verizon.

Put simply, no one should ever pay that much for a Pixel 3 XL, not today in mid-2019 when more modern flagships with better innards and functionality are available. Google often has sales in which the prices of the Pixel 3 XL fall by about $200. And while I feel that those prices—$699 for 64 GB and $799 for 128 GB—are still a bit too high, they are at least a bit more realistic. Google could never justify the pricing on this handset, even when it was new.

Now, I purchased my Pixel 3 XL at half-price during an unusual—OK, unique—half-off sale, and at that price, things change quite a bit. I paid about the same price for my 128 GB Pixel 3 XL as one would today for a 64 GB Pixel 3a XL and while that doesn’t quite make it a no-brainer, it does help me overlook some issues. (I’m looking forward to a higher trade-in value, too, when the Pixel 4 XL appears in October.) This doesn’t help you, of course. Unless Google repeats that sale, which is unlikely.

Despite its excellent cameras, clean Android image, and full Google Fi compatibility, the Pixel 3 XL is hard to recommend, especially at its full asking price: The handset is simply too expensive and has too many design and functional issues. And thanks to the passage of time—the Snapdragon 855 was released earlier this year along with some truly excellent new smartphone flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Huawei P30 Pro—it’s falling further and further away from the top spot. Worse, Google’s recently released Pixel 3a XL is both significantly cheaper and fixes several issues with the more expensive Pixel 3 XL. Awkward!

147,TECHNOLOGY,"Update: Lady Gaga has been confirmed as the performer for Apple’s special event for employees.

The mystery of the rainbow stage at the center of the Apple Park campus was recently solved, Apple’s intranet revealing it to be for the formal opening of the campus …

It isn’t yet known who will be performing, but a Lady Gaga fan account on Twitter has suggested that the American singer-songwriter might be in line for the gig.

Lady Gaga would be a slightly odd choice given Apple’s famous sensibilities. At a recent SAP event, she asked the audience if they were ready to engage in bedroom aerobics – though not in those exact words – and is not really noted as a family-friendly performer.

However, Gaga certainly has the credentials for such a high-profile event.

Gaga has won nine Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Brit Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, several Guinness World Records, and the inaugural Songwriters Hall of Fame’s Contemporary Icon Award. She received a National Arts Awards’ Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have shown accomplishments and leadership early in their career, and she won the Jane Ortner Artist Award from the Grammy Museum in 2016 […] Gaga is one of the best-selling music artists with estimated sales of 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016. Some of her singles are also among the best-selling worldwide. She has grossed more than $512.3 million in revenue from her concert tours and residencies, becoming the fifth woman to pass the half-billion total as reported to Billboard Boxscore. Gaga has consecutively appeared on Billboard magazine’s Artists of the Year (scoring the definitive title in 2010). Named Woman of the Year in 2015, she is the 11th top digital singles artist in the US with a total of 61 million equivalent units certified according to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Beyoncé is another artist who has been suggested as a potential headline act for the concert. The singer has been involved in a number of Apple promos over the years.

148,TECHNOLOGY,"We’ve seen some whacky implementations from phone makers to overcome the notch: pop-up camera, pizza shaped-camera, and even a rotating camera. Now, Asus has added another method to the list by placing a flip-up camera into their latest flagship, the Zenfone 6.

The flip-up hardware acts as both the front and rear cameras. When you want to take a selfie, the motorized camera flips up as shown in the picture below. Besides the dual-camera that flips up, the device’s main highlights are a 6.4-inch edge-to-edge display and a massive 5,000 mAh battery. The phone’s overall spec sheet puts it in the premium mid-range category, alongside the newly launched, non-pro version of the OnePlus 7.

Let’s take a look at what’s under the hood:

There’s not much to say about camera, besides its flip-up construction. Almost every other phone’s opting to use this 48-megapixel sensor. Now that it’s a level playing field, we’ll have to see how Asus’ software can compete with others.

What’s impressive is that Asus has managed to fit a massive battery with dual stereo speakers, and a headphone jack into the device. So, it’s cutting no corners there.

On paper, the phone seems pretty impressive, but it has to overcome the hype of the OnePlus 7 and the upcoming Honor 20 Pro. The device is priced at the starting price of €499 (approx. $560), and will begin shipping in two weeks.

151,TECHNOLOGY,"It only took a year, but Valve’s Steam Link app has finally arrived on the App Store for both iOS devices and Apple TV. Apple originally rejected it in part because its design let you buy games through Steam without letting Apple gets its cut, and so only our friends on Android devices have been able to enjoy the feature for the past 12 months.

But now all that’s behind us. Now that Steam Link is here, it’s a great way to enjoy playing your Mac or PC games with the relative freedom and comfort of an iPhone or Apple TV—at least if you have a strong connection. We’ll start by telling you what you’ll need before you hop into a game, and then we’ll walk you through the steps of setting it up. We'll also help with some troubleshooting. This has been a long time coming, so let’s not waste any more time!

You may have heard of Steam’s separate Steam Link hardware, but don’t worry—you won’t need it if you plan to stream to an iOS device or have an Apple TV. Apart from the controller, you’ll likely already have everything you need.
• An iPhone or iPad running at least iOS 10 or an Apple TV
• A host iMac or MacBook, or a PC running either Windows or Linux. Whatever the system, Steam needs to be installed as well.
• (Highly recommended.) A Steam Controller or an MFi controller. We recommend the Rotor Riot, as it’s the only MFi controller that currently supports the commonly used “L3” and “R3” thumbstick buttons.
• Steam Link lets you use touch controls on the iOS interface, but they’re awkward and not recommended.
• Both the host computer and the iOS device/Apple TV need to be on the same network.

Valve says you’ll get the most out of the Steam Link app if your host computer is connected to an ethernet cable and a 5GHz Wi-Fi router (although we find that a 6GHz router is preferable). Your Apple TV or iOS device also needs to be on that same 5GHz network. You’ll also have better results if you keep your iOS or Apple TV device close to the router.

Again, you'll need a strong connection if you expect Steam Link to work even remotely like it's supposed to. And even at its best, Steam Link gaming isn’t all that hot for games that require fast, “twitchy” reaction times, such as first-person shooters. Unless you have a Google Fiber connection or something similar, it’s currently best suited to slower-paced games that won’t be badly affected by the inevitable delays.

How to set up Steam Link on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV

The focus here is on the iOS version, but the steps are roughly the same for the Apple TV. You just have to search for the Steam Link app on the tvOS App Store yourself.

1. Turn on your Mac or PC and open Steam, and make sure both the iOS device (or Apple TV) and the host computer are on the same network.

2. Download the Steam Link app to your iPhone and open it. Here’s the link for iOS, but on tvOS, you’ll have to navigate to it through the Apple TV App Store.

3. Once the app is open, press the big blue Get Started button. The Steam Link app will then search for computers on the same network.

4. A menu to Pair Controller will pop up. If you have an MFi controller or a Steam Controller, go ahead and connect it, and Steam Link will immediately go to the next step. (If you’ve already connected a gamepad, Steam Link will skip this step.) You can use touch controls on iOS, but they’re unwieldy—and you will need a controller on Apple TV. If you want to live dangerously on the iPhone, though, press Use touch control and Steam Link will advance to the next step.

5. Press the name of the computer that you want to use as a host from the list.

6. You’ll then see a PIN number pop up in the Steam Link app on your iOS device or Apple TV.

7. On your host computer, you should also see a popup from Steam titled Authorize Device. Enter the PIN number from your iOS device in this prompt. Press OK.

8. The Steam Link app on your iOS device will then test your connection and tell you the kinds of streaming speeds you can expect. Press OK when it finishes.

9. On the next page, you’ll want to see three checkmarks for your host computer, your controller, and your connection. You’ll only get a checkmark for your connection if you’re getting download speeds of at least 100Mb/s. (This will be the biggest hurdle for most people, although you can still play with a weak connection.)

10. If you’re cool with all this, press Start Playing.

Here you might run into a couple of speed bumps. If you’re using an MFi controller, Steam will show you shortcuts to accommodate standard gamepad controls that aren’t normally usable with MFi controllers. Again, the Rotor Riot is one of the few exceptions. If you’ve chosen touch controls, Steam Link will show you the even more convoluted shortcuts for those. Press Continue.

Steam may need to download new drivers. If it does, you’ll see a warning on your iOS device that says, “Streaming requires additional driver installation. Please follow the Steam prompts on the remote computer.” On the Mac/PC, a window should pop up in Steam that says, “Gamepad Driver Update: Steam needs to update its gamepad driver, which may require a system reboot.” Press Install in the lower right and follow the steps. On a Mac, you may need to allow the installation to bypass your security settings. You should also restart your Mac. Once this is done and you’ve reopened Steam, press Start Playing again on your iOS device.

11. On the host computer, Steam should open in Big Picture mode—its gamepad-friendly mode—and the feed should start streaming to your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV as well. Find your games under Library and play them!

12. To end streaming on Steam Link, press the Menu button (or equivalent) on your MFi controller, and then scroll to the power symbol in the upper right of the Big Picture interface. Press it.

13. You’ll see a few options. To immediately shut off Steam Link on your iOS device or Apple TV, press Stop Streaming. Steam Link should then close. If you don’t turn off Steam Link this way and try to force-close the app on IOS, Big Picture mode will keep playing on your Mac or PC and you’ll have to disable it there separately.","How to set up Steam Link on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV"

153,TECHNOLOGY,"WASHINGTON, May 17 — Facebook-owned WhatsApp’s revelation of a security flaw allowing hackers to inject spyware on smartphones raised fresh concerns about the security of the mobile ecosystem.

Here are five key questions and answers:

The security hole in the WhatsApp messaging app could enable an attacker to inject malware to gain access to Android or Apple smartphones.

WhatsApp patched the flaw this week after being informed that the spyware was being used to track human rights activists and lawyers.

Security researchers believe the attackers used the powerful Pegasus spyware from Israel-based NSO Group. According to a recent analysis of the software by the security firm Lookout, Pegasus can “subvert” the device’s security and “steals the victim’s contact list and GPS location, as well as personal, Wi-Fi, and router passwords stored on the device”.

The infection could take root with a simple call through WhatsApp. To make matters worse, victims may not know their phones were infected because the malware allowed attackers to erase call histories.

This delivery was “particularly scary”, said security researcher John Dickson of the Denim Group, because it infected devices without any user action.

“Normally a user has to click on something or go to a site, but that wasn’t the case here,” Dickson said. “And once (the attacker) is in, they own the device, they can do anything.”

Who is to blame?

While the flaw was discovered in WhatsApp, security experts say any application could have been a “vehicle” for the spyware payload.

“We have not yet been able to write software that doesn’t have bugs or flaws,” said Joseph Hall, chief technologist for the Centre for Democracy & Technology, a digital rights group.

Hall said the encryption in WhatsApp was not broken and that “Facebook’s response was exceedingly fast.”

Marc Lueck of the security firm Zscaler said that based on Facebook’s response, “You should give them kudos for discovering it in the first place, this was a very deep vulnerability.”

The intrusion at WhatsApp “wasn’t an attack on encryption, it was an attack on another element of the application” said Lueck.

Encryption remains an important feature by establishing a secure “tunnel” between two parties that verifies their identities, Lueck noted.

“Encryption isn’t important just for privacy, it’s important for trust,” he said.

Encryption used by WhatsApp and other messaging applications prevents eavesdropping on messages and conversations but does not protect against an attack that gains access to the device itself, researchers note.

“End to end encryption does nothing to protect against attacks on your endpoint, true. And seatbelts and airbags do nothing to prevent your car from being hit by a meteorite,” tweeted Matt Blaze, a Georgetown University computer security expert.

“While neither protects against every possible harm, they both remain the most effective defences against very common harm.”

Dickson said that while no encryption is foolproof, the only way to completely avoid hacking would be to avoid electronics entirely: “You could use guys on horseback.”

Should I worry about being attacked?

Citizen Lab, a research centre at the University of Toronto, said in a 2018 report that it found Pegasus spyware infections in 45 countries, with 36 “probable government operators”.

NSO maintains it delivers its software for legitimate law enforcement and intelligence purposes. But the Toronto researchers said it had been obtained by countries with “dubious” human rights records and suggested it may have been used by Saudi Arabia to track and kill dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Citizen Lab researchers wrote in the Globe & Mail that they “unearthed at least 25 cases of abusive targeting of advocacy groups, lawyers, scientists and researchers, investigators into mass disappearances and media members.”

But Lueck said programs such as Pegasus are extremely costly and cannot easily be monetised by hackers for profit.

“Your average person is not the target of this specific piece of software, which is built to sell to governments to target individuals and doesn’t work on a large scale,” he said.

Still, Lueck said the flaw underscores the fact that “the mobile phone ecosystem has become as insecure and as vulnerable a platform as the computer”.

Do governments need better digital tools?

The revelations come as governments seek better tools to track criminals and extremists using encrypted messaging. An Australian law requires tech giants to remove electronic protections and help with access to devices or services.

Law enforcement agencies have complained of “going dark” in the face of encrypted electronic communications as they investigate serious crimes like terrorism and child sex offenses.

But Hall said that the news about Pegasus shows governments have tools to exploit software flaws for specific targeting without weakening encryption and privacy for all users.

“You can target the delivery at specific people rather than breaking into everyone’s phone at once,” he said. — AFP","WhatsApp, security and spyware: What happened | Malay Mail"

157,TECHNOLOGY,"by Martin Brinkmann on May 16, 2019 in Windows - Last Update: May 16, 2019 - 19 comments

Reports are coming in that this week's security update for Windows 10 version 1809, KB4494441, may install twice on devices running that particular version of Windows 10.

Microsoft released KB4494441 for Windows 10 version 1809 on Tuesday as part of the company's monthly patch day. The May 2019 update for Windows 10 version 1809 patched a critical security vulnerability in Windows 10, enabled protections against a new class of speculative side-channel vulnerabilities, and enabled Retpoline to optimize protections against the Spectra 2 Variant.

The update included a handful of additional fixes like a patch that fixed error 1309 that Windows threw before when installing certain msi or msp files on a virtual drive.

Administrators who installed the update on machines running that version of Windows 10 may have noticed that they had to do so twice to complete the installation.

Windows Update would list KB4494441 as one of the available updates. Installation of the update requires a restart, and a new check on Windows Update would list the very same update again for installation. The update requires another reboot before it is installed completely on the device.

Microsoft added the issue to the list of known issues on the update's support page on the Microsoft website.

It appears, at least from the update description, that the update is offered twice in some situations only. In other words, not all customers appear to be affected by this.

Microsoft does not reveal why this particular update would require multiple downloads and restart steps on some devices but not on others.

The company notes that users should install the update twice to complete the installation. It reveals that it plans to improve the update experience ""to ensure that the Update history correctly reflects the installation of the latest cumulative update"".

Add the double installation of KB4494441 to the -- still growing -- list of Windows 10 version 1809 issues. I did not notice the issue on two test systems that I installed the update on.

Now You: did you install the update? Did it install twice? Why do you think that is the case?",KB4494441 for Windows 10 version 1809 may install twice - gHacks Tech News
158,TECHNOLOGY,"There was a lot to absorb during yesterday's Super Mario Maker 2 Direct presentation. We found out about the game's story mode, new multiplayer options and extra game styles. Did you know, however, Japan received a slightly different Direct? Yep, the one Japanese viewers saw might have revealed even more information about the anticipated Switch release.

In one part of the 17-minute Japanese video, eagle-eyed viewers noticed an item wheel had nine slots. If you view the same segment in the western Super Mario Maker 2 presentation, you'll see this same item wheel is limited to eight slots:

The wheel in the Japanese presentation features what appears to be a hammer power-up, alongside many other items such as stars and mushrooms which enhance characters in the game and give them new abilities. Take a look for yourself:

This discovery has many wondering if the Hammer Bros. suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 will appear in the sequel, while others seem to think it has some sort of link to Mario's builder outfit. A Gamexplain video suggests the hammer could perhaps be similar to the pickaxe featured in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker.

What do you think? Tell us down in the comments.",New Hammer Power-Up Spotted In Japanese Super Mario Maker 2 Direct
159,TECHNOLOGY,"Instagram is shutting down Instagram Direct, its erstwhile SnapChat competitor, a little over a year after launching the standalone app.

“We’re rolling back the test of the standalone Direct app,” an Instagram statement explains, as if the app was an experiment of some kind. “We’re focused on continuing to make Instagram Direct the best place for fun conversations with your friends.”

“The Direct app is going away,” a more direct message to users of the Instagram Direct app reads. “In the coming months, we’ll no longer be supporting the Direct app. Your conversations will automatically move over to Instagram, so you don’t need to do anything.”

The failure of Instagram Direct is perhaps related to a broader strategy change at Facebook, which his trying to push its core social media service to a more chat-based infrastructure that is, yes, based on the success of SnapChat and other similar apps. In this model, Facebook—and presumably Instagram—would favor more personal conversations over traditional social media posts that often spread misinformation, fake news, and biased viewpoints.

Instagram unveiled its Direct app in December 2017, in effect pulling the messaging functionality from Instagram out into a standalone app. Presumably, the death of Direct means that Instagram will once again pick up this “private sharing” functionality and that planned Direct features will now come to that app instead.",Instagram Direct is Dead
160,TECHNOLOGY,"Bringing together the Modern Warfare and Black Ops worlds, Call of Duty: Mobile is taking the king of shooters to mobile devices.

With a deluge of information pouring out of the closed Beta, more and more details on Call of Duty: Mobile are finally being unearthed. Announced in March 2019, Call of Duty: Mobile won’t be the first CoD you can play on your phone, but it’s looking like it might be the best.

Currently, the game is undergoing a closed Beta on Android devices in India, and soon to be Australia, while a worldwide release is expected in the coming months. However, if you can’t wait until the Beta is avaible in your region and want to know everything you possibly can as soon as possible, look no further! Here’s a roundup of everything we know so far about Call of Duty: Mobile. From Nukes to Zombies, this app is packing a punch.

Since Call of Duty: Mobile is all about bringing together Call of Duty’s biggest two series’, of the seven maps announced, 4 are pulled from Black Ops games while 3 are from the Modern Warfare franchise.

Following suit, the Multiplayer Modes available are also selected from a wide array of Call of Duty’s, even including an oft-forgotten mode from Infinite Warfare. All modes can be played in Ranked matches for XP and rewards or Private matches.

A core part of Call of Duty Multiplayer, Scorestreaks see their return. Unlockable through in-game XP, the current offerings are the Recon Car, UAV, Hunter Killer Drone, Air Supply Drop, Counter UAV, Missile Strike, Drone, Sentry Gun, SAM Turret, Stealth Chopper, and VTOL.

The weapons and loadout system functions most similarly to Infinite Warfare, in which every gun has increasing Rarity levels that offer more XP and an additional perk or two. These better variants can be unlocked through Ranked Play, CoD Points, Credits, leveling up the Battle Pass, or as a Daily Login bonus.

The base variant of every gun can be unlocked by leveling up naturally, and can equip up to three attachments and a scope.

The list of weapons currently available in Call of Duty: Mobile:

While the amount of guns at your disposal matches the standard amount in a CoD game, Call of Duty: Mobile also has a plethora of equipment including: Concussion, EMP, Flashbang, Grenade, Semtex, Smoke Grenade, and Trip Mine.

For the first time in Call of Duty history, players will be able to customize their Equipment with cosmetics as seen in the image above.

Images from the main menu have already revealed that a Battle Royale and Zombies mode is coming to Call of Duty: Mobile some time in the future. We currently do not know if the Battle Royale mode will take place on Blackout Island, Alcatraz Island, or an entirely new map.

However, looking at the image of the zombie, eagle-eyed fans would recognize this walker from press shots for Shadows of Evil. We’ve seen Zombies maps on smartphones in the past, from Nacht det Untoten to Call of the Dead, yet using a Black Ops 3 map as the base Zombies experience for Call of Duty: Mobile would definitely be an interesting move.

Players will be able to customize their characters before jumping into battle by changing their Headgear, Backpack, and Clothing. Call of Duty Veterans will be happy to see series’ legends make appearances as well. Alex Mason (BO1), David “Section” Mason (BO2), Thomas A. Merrick (Ghosts), John “Soap” MacTavish (MW), John Price (MW) are the first to be confirmed.

The nuke is back! When players go on a 30 killstreak in Call of Duty: Mobile, they will have the chance to press the Nuclear button and eliminate the entire enemy team. While this nuke doesn’t end the game, it still feels as awesome as it did in 2009.

As of now, there are three forms of play in Call of Duty: Mobile: Match, Rank Match, and Private Match. While Match is where most casual play will take place, Ranked Matches offer the ability to level up throughout Seasons and earn better Weapons, Bonus XP, and more based on your level and placement.

Borrowing yet another page from Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty: Mobile will offer Daily Login rewards for players who… log into the game daily.

In the Closed Beta, the rewards range from 10 Credits to new Weapon rarities to character skins. Definitely looks like something worth checking in daily to receive.

While pricing and items in the Beta are subject to change, the current model is very reminiscent of Fortnite or PUBG. Players have access to a free and Premium stream of content that rewards them with items per each tier, with the Premium tiers offering better loot than the free tiers.

A welcome addition to these Premium tiers is the inclusion of CoD points as rewards, something still missing from Black Ops 4’s Contraband.

The Store allows players to spend CoD points on new guns, equipment, and skins. Currently, these items are exclusive to the Store and can not be earned in-game, however the Beta grants players with 5000 CoD points to start.

Call of Duty: Mobile has two currencies, CoD Points (the circular icon) and Credits (the hexagonal icon). CoD Points will be bought with real world money or earned through the premium battle pass, while Credits are gained by leveling up in Matches and through both Battle Passes.

Credits can be used to buy items in the Store under the Credits tab such as Legendary guns.

Call of Duty: Mobile will release worldwide on Android and iOS devices in the coming months, however a regional Beta is live right now. To get first access when the Beta goes live in your region, be sure to sign up at https://www.callofduty.com/mobile.

We’ll keep this page updated with more information as we learn additional details on Call of Duty: Mobile, so be sure to bookmark this page!

161,TECHNOLOGY,"In its weekly blog post, Bungie announced plans to nerf some of Destiny 2’s most popular Exotic items in Season of Opulence. Bungie announced that their goal is to keep endgame activities like raids a challenge. But some of these items were too powerful to sustain.

Here are the nerfs coming in Season of Opulence.

The White Nail perk no longer regenerates ammo on three consecutive Whisper of the Worm precision hits. Instead, the gun pulls from its weapon reserves. To compensate, Bungie is increasing Whisper’s reserves to 18.

Sleeper Simulant’s ricochet shots deal less damage. Non-precision hits are more forgiving.

Bungie is decreasing the damage by 20%. Players can now toggle the Release the Wolves — which doubles the shots fired by the weapon per-burst — perk on or off by holding the reload button.

The Memento Mori — which increases the damage of six Ace shots after reloading — now ends when Guardians store Ace of Spades. Memento Mori does slightly reduced damage so it can’t kill enemy Guardians in two headshots under certain conditions. Memento Mori stacks six times now, up from five.

All three of these Exotics earn Super energy back with diminishing returns. It is much more difficult for players to earn an entire Super back.

Bungie is reducing these items’ Super energy cap to make sure these Exotics fall in line with the other Super refund changes.

In PvP, Gwisin Vest only restores 8% energy for killing one or two Guardians, down from 15%.

Bungie says they prefer to buff bad weapons instead of nerfing good ones. However, they’re concerned about constantly upping the power in Destiny 2. They also revealed that this preview is not a full list of changes

The Destiny community have already come out against the changes. The top three spots on the Destiny subreddit are complaints about the changes — with a few posts hitting over 4,000 comments. Frequent world-first raider Gladd also took to Twitter and Twitch to air his and his team’s frustrations. More Destiny content creators have followed.

Bungie has yet to respond to the community’s complaints.",Bungie is nerfing Destiny 2’s most popular weapons
162,TECHNOLOGY,"Google is gunning for India’s payment companies. The U.S. search giant entered India’s payment space in 2017, and now it is hatching an initiative that could boost usage of its Google Pay service by tying it tightly to Android apps in the country.

The company has built an in-app engagement rewards platform that promises to help developers and businesses retain users and drive engagement on their apps, two sources familiar with the matter said. It plans to formally launch the project through partners using an SDK later this year, TechCrunch understands.

Sitting at the core of this new play is Google Pay, which will be used for transactions between businesses and users, thereby expanding the reach of Google’s payment service.

Internally dubbed as Project Cruiser, the initiative has been in the works since last year and it is led by Google’s Next Billion Users team, sources said. Executives from the company have reached out to several businesses in India in recent months to coax them into coming on board, they added.

The platform, if incorporated by developers into their apps, will allow app developers to incentivize users to perform certain actions in their app in a “scalable” fashion. For example, placing their first order, inviting friends or adding a payment method will all result in users earning a small sum of money. In a pitch, Google executives have described these actions as “north star” metrics — something that the company believes its current products do not currently offer.

A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of Project Cruiser, but said, “We’re always looking at ways to serve the next billion users better, but we have nothing to share at this point.”

Part of the rationale behind the project is to help businesses retain customers. A growing number of users are deleting new apps not long after installing them, the company executives have told prospective partners in pitches.

This cash-laden approach of using incentives to fuel engagement is a departure from how Google has typically urged developers to drive engagement on their apps: by building a high-quality experience that uses triggers like notifications in a responsible manner.

The company has an additional incentive at play. It has told developers that all rewards on the app will be bandied through Google Pay. That said, one source told TechCrunch there is a plan to support other payment options from third parties at a later stage, a move that is likely to appease claims of platform abuse. The company has, interestingly, also committed to not take a cut of Google Pay revenue generated from developers through the initiative.

Google has been aggressively pushing the adoption of Google Pay in India, a market where digital payment services have grown exponentially in recent years. The app, initially launched in India as Google Tez in 2017, is the first service from Google to offer users actual money — in the form of cash back — to spur engagement. Late last year, Google ran a promotional campaign that offered Duo video chat users in India up to Rs 1,000 ($14) for inviting friends to the app.

India has emerged as a crucial growth market for Google, which is increasingly looking at developing nations to search for new users and revenue. The U.S. firm clocked $1.4 billion in revenue in India in the fiscal year ending in March 2018, filings show, and the wider Asian region recently became its fastest-growing geography for sales.

In its quest to hold a core position in India, Google has launched a number of services to better serve the needs of users in India and other emerging markets, including data-friendly YouTube Go and Android Go apps. It also funds free Wi-Fi connectivity at 400 railway stations in India, a project that graduated to become Google Stations for several other markets.

Beyond infrastructure-level plays, it has conjured up bespoke products in India. These include tools to help small and medium businesses in India establish an online presence, as well as a neighborhood app, a literacy app and a concierge service. It also acquired the popular app “Where Is My Train” as part of a wider transportation data play.

“We’ve learnt that when we solve for a place like India, we solve for everyone around the world,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, said at an event in New Delhi in 2017.

Google’s user-engagement initiative is potentially a tough development for independent mobile wallets such as Paytm and Mobikwik. Although there’s the potential to add their support later, Project Cruiser promises to give Google Pay a massive boost by tapping into India’s digital cashback culture.

That’s sure to make it an additional concern to those who are increasingly wary of Google’s influence in digital India. Just last month, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) opened an investigation into the alleged abuse of Android’s dominating market position.",Google’s new plan to push Google Pay in India: cashback incentives in Android apps –
163,TECHNOLOGY,"The near-meteoric rise of OnePlus has in large part been thanks to a pretty clear strategy: offer the most important features of the year’s biggest flagships, minus the flashy fluff, at a fraction of the price. With the OnePlus 7 Pro, that all changes.

The 7 and 7 Pro phones mark the first time that OnePlus is releasing two phones at once: the 7 is the natural next step from last year’s 6T, while the 7 Pro is a step up from that. It’s a full-blooded flagship, OnePlus throwing the gauntlet down and trying to prove once and for all that it can make phones to rival the likes of the Galaxy S10 or Huawei P30 Pro if it wants to. And on the strength of the 7 Pro, the company clearly can.

I’ve been using the OnePlus 7 Pro for over a week, and I have been seriously impressed. The core OnePlus ethos is still present, but backed up by better specs focused on two of the areas of the phone people really use the most: the camera and the screen.

The 7 Pro will be available very soon: the phone goes on sale from 21 May.

We're keeping tabs on the best OnePlus 7 Pro (and standard 7) deals right here. Also see our round up of the best cases for the OnePlus 7 Pro.

As for price, it kicks off at the surprisingly affordable £649/$669 for the base model, with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, available in grey. £699/$699 will get you an 8GB/256GB - a very modest price jump for the extra specs, and with a choice of grey, blue, or almond (from June) finishes. If that's still not enough, £799/$749 will get you the mammoth 12GB/256GB configuration, though that's only available in blue.

If you want the cheaper OnePlus 7, there’ll be a little longer to wait - that phone is coming out a couple of weeks later, some time in June, and will start from £499 - the same price as last year's OnePlus 6T. Oddly, this model won't be available in the US, with the 6T remaining as the cheaper option.

Eventually there'll also be a OnePlus 7 Pro 5G version, which will launch with EE in the UK. We're not sure exactly when that's coming though other than 'this summer', or how much it will cost - but it will be fundamentally the same phone as the 7 Pro with the addition of 5G support, though with some potential knock-on effects to performance and battery life.

Easily the first thing you’ll notice about the 7 Pro is the display, which excels in just about every way it is possible for a smartphone screen to excel.

Size? A whopping 6.67in. Refresh rate? A smooth 90Hz. Resolution? QHD+ - or 3120x1440 to be precise. I could go on: colour range, pixel density, curved edges, HDR, Gorilla Glass 5 - on paper this is one of the best panels you’ll find in a smartphone today, and it’s entirely uninterrupted by a notch.

The 90Hz refresh rate is perhaps the most welcome new feature. Mostly limited to gaming phones like the Razer Phone or Asus’s ROG Phone before now, higher refresh rates smooth out animations across the board, leaving every interaction with the phone feeling faster and more fluid.

It’s a change that’s hard to put your finger on at first, but flick between the 60Hz and 90Hz options and you’ll quickly realise that just about everything you do with the phone feels smoother as a result - not to mention the benefits it brings when playing games or watching content that can make the most of the refresh rate.

There’s a battery drain of course, so if you prefer you can drop down to 60Hz - and smartly, even while on this mode the phone will still jump up to 90Hz when you’re, say, playing a game that can make the most of it before dropping back down to 60Hz for your day-to-day stuff.

There’s once again an in-display fingerprint sensor hidden below the surface, though it’s improved from the 6T. OnePlus says it should be almost twice as fast thanks to an upgraded lens and larger sensor area, and it definitely feels it. It still fails to spot my thumb a few times too often, but it feels like this is almost as good as a dedicated physical scanner, which is the highest praise it could hope to get.

Throw in the giant resolution, curved edges (with palm rejection to avoid accidental presses) and support for HDR10+ across both YouTube and Netflix and it’s clear that this screen is something special indeed.

Those curved edges help the phone feel slim - though at 8.8mm it’s not the absolute thinnest device around - while the Gorilla Glass 5 protection extends to the rear as well. This comes in one of three finishes: Mirror Gray, Nebula Blue (pictured), and Almond. The blue in particular is stunning, with a slightly matt effect to the gradient design, while Almond is a creamier take on Apple’s Gold iPhones.

Of course, I can’t talk about the display or the design without addressing the notch - or rather, the lack thereof. The 7 Pro is one of the latest proper full-screen phones to hit the west, in this case by shifting the selfie camera into a small slider that pops up when needed, and retracts just as quickly.

Fall detection means it withdraws if you accidentally drop the phone, and naturally OnePlus assures us it’s tested the mechanism hundreds of thousands of times for durability’s sake. It works for face unlock too, and is astonishingly quick there - the camera retracts almost as soon as it’s opened, so it is still a split-second process.

The selfie shooter isn’t the only exciting camera here though (and beyond the novel design, that one isn’t all that exciting otherwise: it’s a similar 16Mp camera to the one found in the 6T, just in a new spot).

More interesting are the cameras you’ll find when you flip the phone over (after briefly pausing to admire that blue gradient for the umpteenth time, of course). For the first time OnePlus is offering a triple camera setup, and one that could rival the best around.

Let’s take it one lens at a time. The main camera is 48Mp, f/1.6 with optical image stabilisation (OIS). It’s powered by the same Sony IMX586 sensor you’ll find in a few other similar smartphones, but the actual lens is an entirely custom design.

Sitting above the main camera is a 16Mp ultra-wide lens, with an f/2.2 aperture and a 117-degree field of view. There’s a very slight fishbowl effect (which actually looks worse than it is thanks to the curved screen) but otherwise this does a good job.

Finally, and more excitingly, the bottom camera is an 8Mp telephoto, with OIS and up to 3x optical zoom - while you can go up to 10x hybrid optical & digital zoom. This isn’t quite into the 5x optical zoom territory of the Huawei P30 Pro (in fact this whole rear camera setup is almost identical to the regular P30) but it is capable of some seriously sharp zoomed in shots.

The software underlying all that hardware has had an update too, and the newly dubbed UltraShot algorithm is clearly an attempt to catch up with the competition - it’s fair to say OnePlus has never been renowned for its photography flex.

Photos process more quickly, despite additional computational work as the camera makes more use of multiple shots to extract more information and enrich images - especially in a revamped take on Nightscape, OnePlus’s take on a flash-free low light mode. This is now in the same conversation as the P30 Pro and Pixel 3 for lowlight photos, with astonishing sharpness and colour drawn out of even the darkest environments.

In general shots details are crisp and I’ve been impressed by the dynamic range the camera is capable of, while colours tend to be fairly accurate. That can mean photos look slightly muted if you’re used to the heavily saturated shots taken by Huawei and Samsung’s latest, but will deliver if you prefer something that looks more true to life. The optical zoom is comparable to the results in the P30, and actually yields a little more detail than some shots from that phone - though at the cost of slightly more noise.

As for video, the rear cameras can shoot up to 4K at 60fps, while the selfie lens will do 1080p at 30fps, and you also get the option of super slow motion from the rear cameras - either 1080p at 240fps, or 720p at 480fps.

It’s probably clear by now that OnePlus is really leading on the display and camera when it comes to the 7 Pro - two areas where the company has never previously made a name for itself, no doubt not by chance.

Still, it hasn’t exactly skimped elsewhere. The processor is the flagship Snapdragon 855, and it’s backed up by some meaty memory options, with up to 256GB storage and 12GB (!!!) of RAM available - though there’s no support for microSD cards, so what you get is what you get.

That storage is special too: the 7 Pro uses UFS 3.0 - universal flash storage, fact fans - which is a fancy way of saying that it should be able to save and access files much quicker. That means faster app opening, game loading, and file transferring - it's the equivalent to plugging an SSD into your computer. It's also the only phone on sale right now to boast the tech, though technically not the first - the Galaxy Fold uses UFS 3.0 too, but we all know how well that launch went. It's not clear yet how much of a difference the new drive is making in and of itself, but it's contributing to silky smooth performance across the board.

I've been testing the 12/256GB model, and unsurprisingly all that power has seen it sail through most of our benchmarks, with results up there with flagship rivals - though not quite blowing them away, and surprisingly it drops below the 6T on some of the graphical tests, where the extra RAM doesn't really contribute. This is on pre-release software though, which can complicate things, and I'd expect software updates to refine the hardware performance.

Either way, this thing is fast, and it’s at the point where it’s so fast that minor variations in individual benchmarks really don’t reflect anything to worry about unless you’re absolutely obsessed about maxing out your framerate in Fortnite.

The 4,000mAh battery just about stretched out to 48 hours of usage, so if you charge every day you shouldn’t ever have to worry about running out - again, this is pretty much in line with similarly priced rivals. The inclusion of 30W Warp Charging also means it’ll top up fast - it managed to get 64 percent of its battery back in just half an hour when charging from empty.

That charging is USB-C (still no support for wireless here, OnePlus says it just isn’t good enough yet), with a USB 3.1 port. There’s NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 (with aptX HD support), and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos - they sound good for a phone, but y’know. There's even a new haptic motor - something previous OnePlus phones have struggled with. These still aren't the best vibrations out there, but how many people really worry about that?

Finally, waterproofing. OnePlus says getting an official IP rating is a waste of money that drives prices up, so there’s no official measure of how water-resistant the phone is. The company itself says the phone can survive a splash (there’s even an extra layer of liquid protection around the sliding selfie cam) but still doesn’t exactly recommend you take it swimming.

Ultimately, an IP rating offers peace of mind that the 7 Pro just won’t offer in that regard, but as OnePlus is quick to point out, no smartphone manufacturer covers liquid damage in its warranty - even those with industry-leading IP68 ratings. So basically this *should* keep working if you drop it in the bath, but I’m not about to risk the phone and this review to find out.

Let’s wrap it all up on a high note. As ever, OnePlus excels on the software side - Oxygen OS is probably our favourite Android skin, and the only one that’s arguably better than Google’s own efforts on the Pixel phones.

The look is close to stock, but with usability tweaks across the board and subtle UI tweaks to smooth over some of Android’s rough edges. Not everything is perfect - swiping up for back remains one of the less intuitive gesture controls out there, and the lack of a true always-on display is still a frustration - but for the most part this is about as good as Android gets.

Tweaks this year are mostly minor, but welcome. There’s a built-in screen recorder in case you want to share footage direct from your phone, which lets you record for as long as you want, pausing and resuming at any point, and record either internal or external sound.

The full-screen means no room for a notification LED, so instead OnePlus has turned to a software solution: the sides of the display will pulse with light when a notification comes through, with the colour actually determined by the app in question. It's a nice touch, but still actually easy to miss, as the light only pulses once - it won't keep flashing after the fact, as a normal LED might. That could get annoying of course, not to mention drain the battery, which is likely why OnePlus opted to avoid it.

Gaming mode has had an upgrade to give more granular notification controls, and there’s even an enhanced version - branded by the esports team Fnatic - that not only blocks any and all notifications but also re-routes almost all of the phone’s processing power and network signal towards your game.

If that all sounds a bit intense, Zen Mode is its chilled out counterpart. This also shuts down every notification, but goes even further: it basically locks you out of the phone entirely, leaving you able only to receive calls, phone emergency services, or use the camera. This lasts for 20 minutes - no more, no less - and once activated it’s impossible to turn off. Yup, even if you turn the phone off and on again - this is the nuclear solution to terminal procrastination.

I went looking for reasons not to give the OnePlus 7 Pro full marks, but honestly I've struggled to find much to fault. The display, camera, and core specs are essentially all best-in-class - or close enough to count - while the few shortcuts (wireless charging, an IP rating) are easily explained away by a price point that still undercuts the closest comparable rivals by some way.

Yes, this costs a bit more than you're probably used to from OnePlus, but it delivers on enough of its promises to justify that price hike - and if you're not convinced, the regular OnePlus 7 is always there (outside the US at least), at the same ol' price OnePlus has been hitting for the last year or two.

In a year that's already seen both Samsung and Huawei drop pretty phenomenal flagships, OnePlus has still managed to drop a device that might just be the phone to beat in 2019.",OnePlus 7 Pro review

John Wick’s crossover for Fortnite is the second franchise to partner with Epic to deliver such content. While the scale isn’t as big as the EndGame event, the quality of the content is much better overall.

An excellent new LTM with potential for becoming a rotating mode, a high quality skin well worth its price, and even a little easter egg for movie franchise fans. That’s what we call a successful event.

In the John Wick movies, the Continental hotels serve as safe havens to assassins that work under the High Table. The High Table is essentially a ruling class of high class criminals.

While assassins are allowed to kill each other, they cannot do so while on Continental grounds. Doing so has dire consequences for the perpetrator.

In the Wick’s Bounty LTM, players can get a little easter egg when they waltz into the hotel in Neo Tilted.

As you enter the building, the game will force you to stow your weapons. A message will pop up on the screen stating ‘Welcome to the Continental. Remember – No Business While on the Hotel Grounds’.

For fans of the movie franchise, it’s a cool little hidden feature.

In the movies, only those willing to take on the full heat of the High Table attempt to break this rule. If some poor soul does decide to break Continental rules, an extreme bounty will placed on their heads…with a figure that no one can resist.

Mr. John Wick does exactly this in the second installment of the franchise. The third movie, John Wick: Chapter 3, revolves around the consequences of his actions and his efforts to kill every last assassin that’s coming for him.

You can see John Wick 3 in theaters starting May 17th. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as John Wick alongside Halle Berry, Laurence Fishburn, Ian McShane, and many others.",The 'Wick's Bounty' LTM includes an easter egg for John Wick movie fans
166,TECHNOLOGY,"Unimpressed by Apple’s upcoming iPhone 11 and iPhone XR2? New information directly from Apple itself has teased a red-hot new iPhone upgrade that’s worth waiting for.

Picked up by the ever-alert Patently Apple, Apple has quietly filed a patent which reveals its ambitious plans to bring Touch ID back to iPhones. And it works in a way, unlike anything iPhone owners have experienced before.

Taking inspiration from rivals, Apple has detailed how it will build Touch ID into the display of new iPhones by installing an array of pinhole cameras under the screen. Unlike rivals, however, Apple’s patent shows a touch area which fills the screen allowing users to place a finger anywhere to unlock their device. This is a major breakthrough given the unintuitive nature of textureless in-display readers compared to their physical predecessors.

In addition to this, the tech is clearly taking shape since Apple has included photographs of a working prototype. The furthest step yet for technology the company is clearly accelerating, with no less than four in-display Touch ID patent filings since December (1,2,3,4). Including how user fingerprints will not only be mapped, but 3D modelled.

And even Face ID’s biggest fans should be excited. Firstly, the all-new Touch ID is not designed to replace Face ID but to augment it, giving users both an alternative unlock option as well as military grade security by combining both in hypersensitive situations. Yes, payments would be one example, but Apple is thinking bigger already having filed plans for iPhones to replace your passport and that’s where dual biometrics are crucial.

Excited? You should be. No, Apple’s ugly 2019 iPhones won’t get this but we are seeing more and more reasons why you should skip them anyway. Instead, the big 2020 redesign looks more likely. After all, Apple appears very keen for us to know about it.

167,TECHNOLOGY,"Google had egg on its face this week after it had to recall some of its Titan hardware security keys for being insecure.

Titan is Google’s name for its family of hardware security keys that provide two-factor authentication (2FA) for web users.

Launched in July 2018, they offer a level of physical authentication to complement website passwords. Google provides the Titan key for accessing your Google accounts, but you can also use it with other accounts that support the FIDO U2F standard for hardware keys.

When you switch on hardware key support in a website, it asks you to present your Titan key along with your password before it will let you in. This stops thieves who steal your password from accessing your web account.

How do you present your Titan key? It comes in two flavours: a USB key that you plug into your computer, and a Bluetooth-based key that connects wirelessly to your device. This works with computers and with your smartphone, giving mobile users extra protection for their web accounts.

The problem lies with the Bluetooth key, and in particular with its implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This is the protocol it uses to communicate wirelessly with the device it’s authenticating to.

In normal operation, you’d first register your BLE-enabled Titan key with the web service you’re using, generating a secret that is stored on the key.

Whenever you want to access the web-based service, you enter your username and password as you would normally, but the site also asks you to use your hardware key. You press a button on your Titan key. The key uses BLE to connect with your computer or mobile device and send it the secret. The browser on your device then sends the secret on to the web service, which verifies that you’re legit.

So far, so good.

The problem, however, is that Google misconfigured the BLE implementation, so it was insecure. It allows a so-called (MiTM) attack, in which someone could get between your Titan key and the device it’s communicating with. That person could then intercept communications from the key and use them to sign in as you.

Fortunately, the attack can’t be pulled off from the other side of the world: an attacker has to to be within about 10 meters; has to launch their attack just as you press the button on your Titan key; and needs to know your username and password in advance.

But anyone else in the same coffee shop as you, for example, automatically satisfies the first two conditions, so that although this attack is tricky to pull off, it’s far from impossible.

The issue only affects the Bluetooth-enabled keys, not those that you plug into a USB port. To solve it, Google has recalled affected keys and offered a free replacement.

The company also argued that the security flaw still renders the Titan keys more secure than relying just on your password for access:

Google made its own Titan key rather than partner with key manufacturer Yubico, which created the U2F standard with Google in 2014. Yubico threw shade at Google’s Bluetooth choice last year arguing:

Google’s Bluetooth misstep bolsters Yubico’s point. It also won’t do any favours for the concept of hardware keys overall.",Google recalls Titan Bluetooth keys after finding security flaw

170,TECHNOLOGY,"Last month, Verizon and AT&T made official something you’ve probably been aware of for a while: American smartphone owners are upgrading a lot less than they used to. In fact, they’re hitting record lows at the two biggest US carriers, with people apparently more content than ever to keep hold of their existing device. This is a global trend, as the smartphone market is reaching maturity and saturation in many developed nations, and yet it’s most pronounced in the United States for a few reasons particular to the country.

If you were to ask me to name the most exciting phones of 2019, top of my mind would be Huawei’s P30 Pro, with its exotic array of cameras and unmatched low-light photography, closely followed by the OnePlus 7 Pro and its gorgeous 90Hz screen. Is either of those phones available on AT&T or Verizon? Nope. Huawei is effectively banned by the US government, while OnePlus only has a distribution deal with T-Mobile in the country, which is better than nothing but still comparatively niche.

The typical American smartphone buyer knows a choice between only two brands: Apple and Samsung. Peruse the online offerings of AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, and you’ll see a parade of various models from those two companies, punctuated by the occasional LG also-ran and Kyocera obscurity. If you scroll down far enough, you’ll get to see the Red Hydrogen One, which is a garbage phone, but it’s from a US company, so they let it in.

Geopolitics playing out in US carrier stores

Chinese phone brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have leading positions in most of the world’s markets now, but in the US they’re almost entirely absent. For a Chinese phone maker to get a device onto a US carrier, it has to do that via the backdoor means of putting a familiar brand on it, such as TCL is doing with its BlackBerry and Palm handsets. Even OnePlus is mostly a palatable brand in front of the same giant Chinese conglomerate that operates the Oppo and Vivo brands. The US government’s geopolitics is playing out in carrier stores, narrowing consumer choice to products from US companies, mainly Apple, or manufacturers from US-allied nations like South Korea.

Being limited to two providers might not be a problem if they were competing as hard as they possibly could, but both Apple and Samsung appear content with mostly iterative upgrades. “Incremental changes from one model to the next hasn’t been that great, and it hasn’t been enough of an incentive,” according to Verizon CFO Matt Ellis.

Think about the things that make a Samsung Galaxy S10 compelling: a beautiful display with tiny bezels, a very good camera, a large battery with wireless charging, fast performance, water resistance, and, as a bonus, a headphone jack. The three-year-old Galaxy S7 has all of those things. An S7 owner can absolutely want an S10, but they certainly don’t need one. It’s a situation that looks a lot like the one with Windows laptops, where screen bezels are disappearing, everything is becoming lighter and faster, but the rate of improvement is too gradual to compel most people to upgrade in a hurry.

Apple did have a major redesign with the iPhone X in 2017, sparking a wave of upgrades from people who’d been waiting for such a dramatic change, but the company has otherwise kept to a conservative cadence when it comes to introducing new hardware features and capabilities. You’d certainly struggle to tell the difference between an iPhone X and XS, just as you would struggle to differentiate between an iPhone 6 and a 6S on first glance.

Without the likes of Huawei to push them into more aggressive upgrade cycles, Apple and Samsung can afford to keep pace only with one another, at least in the US market. Huawei’s breakneck pursuit of new features has proven extremely enticing for phone buyers in Europe and across the rest of the world, with the Chinese vendor racking up 50 percent growth in phone shipments in the first quarter of 2019 while Samsung and Apple both faltered.

The new economics of super flagships

It’s a badly kept secret that mobile carriers worship at the altar of ARPU (average revenue per user). Increasingly, they’re bundling their phone line rentals with subscriptions to premium video or music services, and they’re offering long-term payment plans to help people buy the super flagship $1,000 phones that Apple, Samsung, and Google have been offering. That strategy has worked surprisingly well, with consumers seeing only a marginal increase in their monthly cost and valuing the increased capabilities (or sheer aesthetic and luxury appeal) of those exclusive-tier devices.

But there are two long-term issues for hardware manufacturers selling ultra pricey handsets. One is that the person that spends double what they previously did on a phone would, naturally, expect to keep their shiny new phone for somewhere close to twice as long. Apple has been great about supporting many generations of iPhones with its latest iOS updates, and even though Android vendors haven’t been anywhere near as good, many people can carry on just fine with an older version of Android as well. The other big issue is that the addressable market of people willing to spend four figures on a phone is inherently small.

Phone manufacturers and carriers in the US have shifted the most innovative and appealing devices to a price point that’s simply unattainable for a majority of people. They’ve masked it well, but it’s still a lot of money. Samsung’s cheapest Galaxy S10 variant, the S10E, is still $749. Americans’ smartphone budgets haven’t risen at the same pace as smartphone prices, and now when they look at their usual price range, they just see a lack of meaningful innovation. The OnePlus 7 Pro is a rare exception, bringing a devastatingly handsome, bezel-less display to the sub-$700 market.

Satisfied existing customers, a failure to deliver innovation to price points where people would be ready to upgrade, and the almost total absence of Chinese competition have sapped the US phone market’s vitality. Smartphones are still fun, exciting, and full of novel features, but you might have to go outside the United States to find one that’s both compelling and affordable.",Three big reasons why Americans aren’t upgrading their phones
171,TECHNOLOGY,"Facebook is “working to restore” a number of groups that were erroneously removed or affected by “sabotage,” according to the company. A spokesperson told The Verge the social network “removed several groups from Facebook after detecting content that violated our policies.” After investigation, it discovered content had been “posted to sabotage legitimate, non-violating groups.” Facebook is working to restore any groups affected and to “prevent this from happening again.”

The situation allegedly began on May 13th. A popular meme account on Facebook known as Crossovers Nobody Asked For (CNAF), which boasts more than 500,000 members, was suddenly shut down. The group’s administrators tried to corral its users into a new group, “Crossovers Nobody Asked For ‘Season 2,’” but that got shut down just one day later.

Know Your Meme reported that members of CNAF were able to track down a screenshots of a group known as Indonesian Reporting Commission (IReC) celebrating CNAF’s page being taken down, leading to suspicions among those involved that IReC was behind the attacks. Facebook would not confirm if the Indonesian Reporting Commission, which gets groups and pages suspended through posting questionable content and mass reporting it, was behind the false flags.

The news spread quickly, and caused thousands of popular Facebook pages to switch from “private” to “secret” mode in order to prevent themselves from being shut down. While closed Facebook groups require moderators to approve someone’s request to join, secret groups are virtually undetectable. A group moderator has to personally invite someone to join; you can’t just search for it.

The attack on two high-profile groups, though seemingly isolated, has been felt by a substantial number of Facebook users. People complained on Facebook and Twitter about waking up to an array of notifications from various groups they belong to recognizing the status change from “private” to “secret.” Others have spoken out about their own groups asking members to be patient as they lay low. Facebook users have started calling it “The Great Zuccening of 2019” or in some cases “Groupocalypse.”

The incident is concentrated largely among a network of popular meme pages and groups. But the fear of suspensions or bans at the hand of Facebook’s algorithmically-driven reporting system, supposedly underpinned by its ongoing AI efforts, underlines the vulernability of the social network’s s moderation approach.

Facebook has long had issues with overseeing user-uploaded content. Those issues extend to everything from its heavy-handed stance on nudity, which gets popular artwork and famous photographs erroneously pulled down, to its failure to recognize when immediately viral content, like the Christchurch shooting, is in fact a graphic video violating multiple rules that needs to be uniformly blocked. Though this is a relatively anodyne situation involving meme pages, the widespread panic among some of the most active groups and pages on the platform shows how little faith users have in the company’s ability to foresee these issues and prevent fallout, rather than react after the fact.

One group dedicated to BoJack Horseman shitposts posted a link to the Know Your Meme explainer on the situation, notifying members that they were “doing the hide from the mean jerks reporting groups thing.” Frank Scarsella, the group’s admin, told The Verge he first noticed what was happening after “several of the pages I am just a member of started throwing up these notifications.

“Some of those groups I’m in were much more likely to be targets, honestly, but I immediately let my team know so we could discuss our own moves,” Scarsella said.

There was a conversation amongst Scarsella and his moderators when the notification flags from other groups started picking up, and they debated about whether they should close i their own group in response. Most of the team wanted to air on the side of caution, Scarsella said, adding “the comfort of the group is always paramount to me, so for the sake of reducing fear, I sided with closing off the group.”

“For the sake of reducing fear, I sided with closing off the group.”

“Better safe than sorry,” as Scarsella said, seems to be the reason for the panic across Facebook. Know Your Meme’s managing editor Don Caldwell thinks that after users started waking up to notifications of group status changes, and after stories started spreading about a suspicious Facebook group reporting a series of popular pages with hundreds of thousands of members, “people got pretty spooked.”

“All the spam notifications that went out to all those members, and rumors that started spreading, getting posted in those groups — it becomes a big thing,” Caldwell said.

There’s an issue with changing a group from private to secret, though. If the status isn’t changed within 24 hours, the group has to remain secret for another 28 days. This isn’t a big deal for tinier groups built on a close-knit community — something that Facebook has tried to promote recently — but it does matter for pages who want to build a member base. Caldwell couldn’t predict whether groups will remain secret for some time or start to revert back, but people are spooked enough that every precaution is being taken. Even Scarsella, who doesn’t think it’s likely “someone in the group will go on a mass reporting spree,” is worried about possible repercussions.

“The group is a very important community to so many people, myself included,” Scarsella said. “There is always worry that the platform could remove that community. I’d say [we’re] mildly worried because it seems unlikely, but would have heavy repercussions for us.”

Some of the groups removed in the original flood of mass reporting, including Crossovers Nobody Asked For, have since returned to Facebook.",Facebook says it will restore groups infiltrated by saboteurs
172,TECHNOLOGY,"Instagram’s pivot to Stories continues with an overhaul of Explore designed to let users dig deeper into their niche interests. Stories are now eligible to show up in the Explore tab for the first time, giving creators a way to get discovered through their intimate, silly, behind-the-scenes content instead of just their manicured feed posts. Since Stories themselves don’t get Likes, Instagram will personalize which Stories you see on Explore by showing accounts similar to ones you do Like and Follow. We’ve got more tips on how the Explore Stories algorithm works below.

Additionally, Instagram Explore is getting a redesigned navigation bar up to with shortcuts to Shopping and IGTV first, followed by channels for topics like Travel, Food, and Design. In a nod to how central Instagram sees Shopping and IGTV to its future, those categories will also get big square portals inset within the Explore grid. Tapping these squares or shortcuts for Shopping reveals category filters for specific proucts like Clothing, Beauty, and Home Decor. For IGTV, they pull up an new vertical scrolling IGTV discovery grid to contrast with its old horizontal scrolling carousel.

The goal is that “Explore shows you the full breath of content on Instagram that are relevant to your interests” says Instagram product lead for discovery Will Ruben. The more creators you discover through Explore, the more you have to look at on Instagram, and the more ads you end of seeiing. “These changes also signal the future direction we’ll be taking with Explore. We’re really investing in making IGTV and Shopping a big part of Explore experience. A home for Instagram’s big bets like Shopping and IGTV. We want to provide a more immersive experience so people can actively engage with content and be more specific about what they want to discover.” That should quiet questions about whether Instagram will abandon IGTV after a lackluster first year in the market.

How To Get On The Instagram Explore Tab

You’ll now start to see auto-playing Stories clips on the Explore grid. Tapping one will let you watch that Story, and then swipe through more topically similar Stories. For example, if you tap into a Story about dogs on Explore, you’ll likely see more dog Stories queued up. This seamless way to sift through content means there’s a ton of opportunity for influencers and artists to gain followers through Explore.

Instagram tells me that its algorithm is looking for several things when determining what to show on Explore. This is not an exhaustive list of signals that determine what shows up on Explore, which would also include recency and other factors. Explore is also personalized for every user, so showing up to one person doesn’t mean others will see a piece of content there too But here’s what Instagram told us were some of inputs for deciding what Stories appear in Explore:
• The strongest input is what the viewer already follows and Likes in the feed. Instagram will try to show similar Stories in Explore, so if someone Likes and follows a lot of accounts you, it will show Stories from other people they Like and follow but you don’t yet
• Videos have the potential to be ranked higher than photos since videos auto-play in Explore and tend to get more attention, but great photos will still rank above mediocre videos
• Highly-visual Stories that don’t include too much text will get preference
• Stories with content more similar to and representative of a creator’s typical feed posts are more likely to show up on Explore
• Certain content types like reposts of other people’s feed posts are demoted by the algorithm
• Computer vision that detects what the actual content of a Story is helps Instagram show you ones similar to the content you interact with most, though this is a weaker signal than those above.

So if you’re followed and Liked by people similar to someone, and post visually-compelling video Stories without too much text that are indicative of the topics you typically post, you could earn a spot on the Explore tab.",Instagram adds Stories to Explore tab. Here’s how to get on it –

Google tracks a lot of what you buy, even if you purchased it elsewhere, like in a store or from Amazon.

Last week, CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a New York Times op-ed that said ""privacy cannot be a luxury good."" But behind the scenes, Google is still collecting a lot of personal information from the services you use, such as Gmail, and some of it can't be easily deleted.

A page called ""Purchases "" shows an accurate list of many — though not all — of the things I've bought dating back to at least 2012. I made these purchases using online services or apps such as Amazon, DoorDash or Seamless, or in stores such as Macy's, but never directly through Google.

But because the digital receipts went to my Gmail account, Google has a list of info about my buying habits.

Google even knows about things I long forgot I'd purchased, like dress shoes I bought inside a Macy's store on Sept. 14, 2015. It also knows:
• I ordered a Philly cheesesteak on a hoagie roll with Cheez Whiz and banana peppers on Jan. 14, 2016.

174,TECHNOLOGY,"It’s already something of a tradition for big publishers to remove DRM software Denuvo from their newest releases, especially once crackers manage to break through it. BioWare removed it from Mass Effect Andromeda in 2017, and Bethesda Softworks previously removed it from DOOM and Dishonored 2. Now, two days after release, they are also removing it from Rage 2 on Steam. This may be due to the fact that the Bethesda.net release never included this DRM software, and, according to KitGuru, that release allowed crackers to work with a clean executable file. Then, all they had to do was bypass the Bethesda.net online store check-in.

According to the Steam update, the removal of Denuvo was because Bethesda “saw a few requests.” About 40% of current reviews on the game’s Steam page are negative, and many of which clamor for Bethesda to remove Denuvo. Along with the Denuvo removal, the update also fixes some crash issues related to Scaleform and an occasional crash on startup. It also enables the Crash Reporter so users can now help improve the game by sharing details on their crash issues. Another issue was sorted for Bethesda.net users, and the Razer Chroma keyboard effects are now enabled by default. Bethesda says they will continue to review Steam forums and reviews for reported issues, and any other technical support issues should be forwarded to their customer support site.

175,TECHNOLOGY,"A server-side update is being sent out to the mobile YouTube app, according to Android Police . It doesn't contain a major change, but for those who like to view streaming YouTube videos in fullscreen (which is done by holding the phone in landscape orientation), it does help correct a minor annoyance.

Before the update, let's say you were viewing a video in landscape mode and wanted to share it with some one, or give it a thumbs up or down, or even add the video to a playlist. You would have to make the switch from landscape to portrait in order to find the appropriate icon to tap on. Then, when ready to view another video, you would have to turn the phone back to landscape mode. But the powers that be at Google recognized the inherent dangers involved when a phone owner keeps changing the orientation of his device; such a move can lead to a fumble resulting in the handset kissing the asphalt or another hard surface. It is also just plain inconvenient.

Still, it isn't a big deal, but as Android users know, Google loves to correct minor pain points. So the update adds the bar containing the thumbs up, thumbs down, share and save icons to the YouTube UI in landscape. To view it, simply scroll up on the screen in fullscreen mode. You will see three recommended videos overlayed on top of the screen, and directly underneath is the bar with the aforementioned icons. Note that the up and down thumbs still show how many times a video was ""liked"" or ""disliked.""



The change appears on version 14.18.56 of the YouTube app for Android. Not only might it save you from dropping your phone (even surehanded NFL running backs fumble the ball without contact every now and then), over the course of a year it just might save you a few minutes of time.",Update to mobile YouTube app makes life a little bit easier
176,TECHNOLOGY,"Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg took the opportunity during an appearance at the J.P. Morgan investment conference today to boast about speeds the carrier is seeing in Chicago today with the new Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, Samsung’s first 5G smartphone in the U.S.

Usually, when a new generation of wireless technology comes around, such as with 3G and 4G, the first phones are “very clunky” and not user friendly, he said. But, the S10 can leverage 4G or 5G, and is the best 4G phone that Samsung has ever offered, he said, adding, “That’s exciting,” along with longer battery life, the cameras and “all of that.”

Referring to an Ookla speed test in Chicago, “we had 1.5 Gigabits per second on the phone this morning,” he said. “We’re excited” about this phone.

Besides Chicago and Minneapolis, Verizon previously named another 20 cities that will be getting its 5G Ultra Wideband service this year: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Des Moines, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Little Rock, Memphis, Phoenix, Providence, San Diego, Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C.

The most data usage is in the urban areas, and that’s where Verizon is building 5G first. “Then, we still have the best 4G network” whenever users go outside those areas, and it’s seamless in between, Vestberg said. “Ultimately, all spectrum that we have will be 5G spectrum.” However, customers need to migrate to the newer technology over time, and the way to do that is with the phone. The Samsung Galaxy S10 is exclusive to Verizon for a limited time.

RELATED: Verizon says consumers will self-install 5G fixed service when it relaunches

Over the next few years, “I think the majority of our map will have 5G,” he said. Every new wireless technology is better than the previous one, so there’s an incentive to put 5G in the network: It handles data more efficiently, and the cost per bit comes down.

One acronym to remember, he said, is DSS, for dynamic spectrum sharing, which is a feature allowing for more flexible use of spectrum, dynamically changing whatever phone the user has. “That’s a very important feature” coming to the network next year, he said. “Then we don’t need to discuss whether it’s 4G or 5G, whatever phone you have is going to use it. That’s basically how dynamic spectrum sharing is working.”

RELATED: Verizon CEO on mmWave: Early days but engineering team good with it

With 4G, there was basically one business case, and that was consumer wireless. But, with 5G, there are at least four business cases. The first one is consumer wireless, with higher throughputs and speeds. “We are Number One in that market,” he said, and Verizon has high ambitions to increase to create higher market share.

The second business case is 5G Home, which uses the same infrastructure and investment and expands the market. “We can expand the market because right now, we’re on the East Coast with FiOS, but over time, we can have 5G Home in any place where we have 5G mobility on millimeter wave and we have that our ambition is to cover 30 million homes with 5G,” he noted.

The third business case involves the use of 5G for edge cloud computing, addressing enterprises to transform logistic flows and offer things like private 5G networks. That’s cloud computing at the edge compared to the big cloud providers doing it in the data centers. “It’s coming much closer to you so you can transform and change,” he said.

The fourth is lower cost to transport the bits, all using the same infrastructure. Fixed wireless access failed in countries around the world because it used a separate network. Now, Verizon is using the same base stations and antennas. “You need to have almost unlimited spectrum, or at least a high degree of spectrum,” he said, adding that Verizon has some 1,000 megahertz spectrum nationwide on millimeter wave. “That’s how we see it.”

Verizon is building fiber in 60 cities around the country, and given that it has a multi-customer environment, it decided to build it rather than rent or acquire. It’s building rings, not point-to-point, and that’s a big difference from an architectural point of view. With rings, “you can serve so much more,” and monetize the assets so much better, he said.",Verizon’s Vestberg touts network speed amid Samsung 5G smartphone launch
177,TECHNOLOGY,"Today, Sega announced 10 more games for its upcoming Mega Drive Mini console – and one of the most exciting inclusions is Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition, the very first Sega port of Capcom's seminal one-on-one brawler.

There's just one small problem: the Mega Drive Mini ships with a 3-button pad in the west. Only the Japanese edition has the 6-button pad required for making the most of Street Fighter II's 'three punch, three kick' button setup.

Why Sega chose to go to the trouble of making a 3-button pad when the 6-button pad Japan is getting is clearly superior is anyone's guess, but all is not lost. If you're getting the US or Euro model then you can pick up one of RetroBit's excellent (and officially-licenced) 8-button controllers which are a dead ringer for the original pad and should (in theory) be just as good as the ones included with the Japanese Mega Drive Mini. It's worth noting that the Sega Saturn USB pads – also part of RetroBit's range – will work as well.

If you'd rather not have those spare L and R buttons, then RetroBit is releasing a revised version of the controller in August which should be more to your liking. Whichever you choose, 6 is quite plainly better than 3, and if you want to play Street Fighter II on your Mega Drive Mini the way Capcom intended, then expect to pay a little extra.",Looks Like RetroBit's 6-Button Pad Will Be Essential For The Mega Drive Mini
178,TECHNOLOGY,"Samsung is still committed to an imminent relaunch of its super-expensive foldable handset. The one that was supposed to have been on the market by now but was yanked at the eleventh hour after high-profile reviewers and tech outlets found a slew of problems with the Galaxy Fold — which, it turns out, was unacceptably fragile for a device with a nearly $2,000 price tag.

We know Samsung is still committed to the device because the company keeps telling us so. And we also know the company is still committed because it’s racing to fix the sloppy work that dogged the first version of the Galaxy Fold to ensure that it’s finally ready for prime time.

That’s according to Korean media, which is reporting that the relaunched version of the Fold could arrive as early as June, with Samsung’s top mobile executive DJ Koh promising to reveal the new release date soon.

This new report, meanwhile, walks through the myriad changes and fixes that Samsung has started bringing to the device. They include making the top protective layer of the phone now essentially part of the body, instead of something that resembles the kind of screen protector that users instinctively want to peel off.

Removing that layer was mentioned as one of the causes cited for why some reviewers ended up with bricked or near-useless devices. Samsung had reportedly cautioned that the layer wasn’t supposed to be removed during Galaxy Fold press briefings, but that fact apparently wasn’t clear when reviewers finally had the device in their hands.

Samsung is also reportedly trying to shrink the gap that existed on the top and bottom of the Fold’s hinge, where dirt particles and the like not only started inadvertently slipping inside but also got lodged under the display and started causing problems. The new report says Samsung is trying to make that gap smaller, which is certainly a good thing.

Again, we shouldn’t have to wait long to see if the changes make a difference in how the device is received publicly. It’s a dramatically different new form factor for a cell phone, and today’s report notes that mobile carriers in South Korea are testing the tweaked Galaxy Folds now ahead of what looks to be an imminent relaunch of the device.",Here’s what Samsung is doing to fix the Galaxy Fold’s embarrassing mistakes

180,TECHNOLOGY,"Google’s surprise announcement that it would replace its Home brand with Nest was well-received. Then all hell broke loose.

The issue here has nothing to do with branding. Instead, users became outraged when they learned that, as part of the transition from Google Home to Google Nest, Google would be killing its “Works with Nest” platform and replacing it with the existing “Works with Google Assistant” program. Works with Nest is a sort of certification program for compatibility, and the underlying platform ensures that individual Nest devices and Nest-compatible third-party devices can work together to provide seamless and automated whole-house smart home functionality.

The original plan was to shut down Works with Nest on August 31, 2019, at which time all Nest users’ carefully-constructed smart home configurations would stop working. Worse, it’s not yet possible to completely recreate these configurations in Google Home, let alone import Nest configurations. And some makers of third-party Nest-compatible devices began notifying their users that things would start to break.

“The ability to automate lighting functions based on the Nest’s home and away status, person alerts from Nest cameras, or smoke or carbon monoxide detection from a Nest Protect will be affected by the change,” an email from smart lighting firm Lutron reads, explaining the change. “It will also remove the ability to control the Nest thermostat from within the Lutron smartphone app.”

Additionally, some privacy advocates who were already not that excited that Google owned Nest in the first place complained that Google was breaking its promise to keep Nest and Google user data separate from each other.

So, Google has replied to the complaints and is adjusting its plans.

“We’re committed to supporting the integrations you value and minimizing disruptions during this transition,” Google’s Michele Turner writes. “[Now], we’ll stop accepting new Works with Nest (WWN) connections on August 31, 2019. Once your WWN functionality is available on the Works with Google Assistant (WWGA) platform you can migrate with minimal disruption from a Nest Account to a Google Account.”

WWGA, Google says, already works with over 30,000 devices from over 3,500 partners. And the firm believes that this platform’s Assistant Routines feature, which lets users customize how their smart devices work together based on simple triggers, is a suitable replacement for Nest’s broader set of built-in functionality. But Google will evolve Assistant Routines to work more like Nest.

“Later this year, we’ll bring the [WWN functionality to automatically trigger routines based on Home/Away status] to the Google Assistant and provide more device options for you to choose from,” Turner continues. “For example, you’ll be able to have your smart light bulbs automatically turn off when you leave your home. Routines can be created from the Google Home or Assistant apps, and can be created using the hardware you already own. Plus we’re making lots of improvements to setup and managing Routines to make them even easier to use.”

Google is also working with Amazon to migrate the Nest skill that lets users control their Nest thermostat and view their Nest camera livestream via Amazon Alexa.

Google has owned Nest since 2014, but it didn’t merge the Nest and Google hardware teams until 2018. Many had expected Google to eventually kill the Nest brand in favor of Google Home, but this month it did the opposite, when it killed Google Home as a hardware brand and replaced that with Nest.",Google Clarifies What’s Happening to “Works with Nest”

Google has released a new feature that lets you tell it to automatically delete the data it keeps about you, but it's not complete.

184,TECHNOLOGY,"Intel has disclosed vulnerabilities called Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) that apply to desktop and notebook computers with Intel CPUs, including all modern Mac computers. Although there are no known exploits affecting customers at the time of this writing, customers who believe their computer is at heightened risk of attack can use the Terminal app to enable an additional CPU instruction and disable hyper-threading processing technology, which provides full protection from these security issues. This option is available for macOS Mojave, High Sierra and Sierra and may have a significant impact on the performance of your computer. Testing conducted by Apple in May 2019 showed as much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks. Performance tests are conducted using specific Mac computers. Actual results will vary based on model, configuration, usage, and other factors.

We reached out to Intel to get their official response and this is what they had to say about the matter:

Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) is already addressed at the hardware level in many of our recent 8th and 9th Generation Intel® Core™ processors, as well as the 2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor Family. For other affected products, mitigation is available through microcode updates, coupled with corresponding updates to operating system and hypervisor software that are available starting today. When these mitigations are enabled, minimal performance impacts are expected for the majority of PC client application based benchmarks. Performance or resource utilization on some data center workloads may be affected and may vary accordingly. Once these updates are applied, it may be appropriate for some customers to consider additional steps. This includes customers who cannot guarantee that trusted software is running on their system(s) and are using Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). In these cases, customers should consider how they utilize SMT for their particular workload(s), guidance from their OS and VMM software providers, and the security threat model for their particular environment. Because these factors will vary considerably by customer, Intel is not recommending that Intel® HT be disabled, and it’s important to understand that doing so does not alone provide protection against MDS. We’ve provided more information on our website and continue to encourage everyone to keep their systems up to date, as its one of the best ways to stay protected. Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

So as it stands right now, if you are in the security conscious camp, you have two choices. You can either upgrade to an Intel 8th Generation or higher processor or you can turn off hyper threading. Unfortunately however, since turning off hyper threading will not protect you against the rest of the speculative execution related threads, there is no real point in doing so and earning the performance cost.

Ever since the Meltdown and Spectre reveals, a brand new branch of attacks has been opened for security researchers to exploit in modern processors and it will take a couple of generations before the semiconductor industry can iron out the kinks and roll out hardware level mitigations for these. Interestingly, almost all of these attacks have to do with processors guessing how a certain instruction is going to end in advance and if the veracity of these attacks is anything to go by – they are pretty good at it!","Intel MDS Vulnerabilities Affecting 7th Gen And Below May Slow Macs By Up To 40%, Apple Warns"
185,TECHNOLOGY,"Back in February, Google launched two Android apps to help improve accessibility on Android. One of those apps was Live Transcribe, a live-captioning app that can transcribe speech in real-time, in multiple different languages.

Today, Live Transcribe is getting a new update to be more useful. In the past, Live Transcribe was only capable of transcribing speech — meaning importing things like background noise, or things that were actually happening were harder to capture. With today’s update, Live Transcribe can transcribe sound events, so you will now be able to tell when things are happening in the background as well as being able to transcribe speech. So for example, when a dog is barking, the app will let you know with a simple tag at the bottom.

The sound events aren’t embedded within the speech transcriptions, and instead, they are at the bottom, wrapped within little squares. It’s an interesting design choice because the sound events are so far from the actual speech transcriptions.

Google is also making it possible to locally copy and save transcripts, which is going to be really useful for students like me taking notes in lectures. I don’t have an Android phone, unfortunately.

186,TECHNOLOGY,"As iPhone sales turn sluggish, Apple is counting more and more on the installed base of iPhones for revenue growth. To make this transition from hardware sales to work, Apple has aggressively expanded its Services unit by adding Apple News+, Apple TV+ and the upcoming Apple Arcade to its offerings. The Services segment is Apple's second largest division and is it's most profitable. Besides the previously mentioned additions, under the Services umbrella, you'll find Apple Music, the App Store, iTunes, AppleCare, Apple Pay and more. Apple is looking to expand revenue generated by this division from the $25 billion it collected in 2016 to $50 billion next year. For the fiscal second quarter ended in March, Apple generated $11.45 billion of Services revenue.

So as we pointed out, Apple really depends on the installed base of iPhones. But there is some bad news for Apple on this front; according to CIRP (via 9to5Mac ) growth in the installed base of iPhones in the U.S. barely moved the needle in the first quarter of 2019. CIRP says that this number rose by only 4 million to 193 million at the end of March resulting in just 2.1% growth over the three month period. On a year-over-year basis, the growth in the installed base of iPhones in the states was 12%. To show you how growth in this key metric is slowing, for the first quarter of 2018 the sequential growth was 4% and 19% year-over-year.

The latest figure released by Apple showed that at the end of the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, the global iPhone installed base was 900 million units. That gives Apple a large number of potential subscribers to collect recurring revenue from. 



""The U.S. installed base of iPhones continues to plateau. Relative to the most recent quarters, and especially to the past two or three years, slowing unit sales and longer ownership periods mean that the growth in the number of US iPhones has flattened considerably. Of course, 12% growth in a year, after years of much greater growth is still good. However, investors grew accustomed to quarterly growth of 5% or more, and annual growth of almost 20%. This continuing trend prompts investors to wonder if iPhone sales outside of the US will compensate, and places greater pressure on Apple’s determination to sell other products and services to the installed base of iPhone owners.""-Josh Lowitz, Partner, and Co-Founder, CIRP

Services revenue could be hurt by the attacks on the so-called ""Apple Tax""



While Apple no longer releases the number of iPhone units sold each quarter, it does release revenue figures for the device. During the fiscal first quarter, iPhone revenue declined 15% year-over-year. Things got worse during the fiscal second quarter (January through March) when revenue attributed to the device declined 17% year-over-year. The upgrade cycle has expanded, but if current members of the installed base don't replace their currently used iPhone with a newer iPhone model, the installed base could start to decline.",Lower growth in one key U.S. metric could hurt Apple's most profitable unit
187,TECHNOLOGY,"Echo VR developer Ready at Dawn explained in a short blog post how the game will work with the inside-out tracked Touch controllers on Oculus Rift S.

The developer also praised the higher resolution display of the Rift S, claiming it makes it “easier to read name tags and help pick out snipers from far away.”

Whereas the original Rift used external USB sensors for tracking, the Rift S uses five onboard cameras instead.

The headset tracking works using advanced computer vision algorithms, but the controller tracking operates in a similar way to Rift- the cameras track the infrared LEDs under the plastic of the tracking rings. The difference is that the cameras are on the headset instead of external.

Like Windows MR headsets, these cameras use wide angle fisheye lenses. But unlike Windows MR headsets, there are a total of five cameras instead of just two. This means that the tracked range extends far beyond your visual field of view, even to the sides, above, and somewhat behind.

Even with five cameras, there are still situations in which a controller will not be in view of any of them. If you’re facing one direction and extend your hand out in another direction, for example. Or if you reach completely behind your back.

This is a real problem for Echo VR because the game uses a fairly unique locomotion system based on grabbing and pushing against the environment. You often need to push off a wall directly behind you, or directly behind the headset when looking away from the wall. Echo VR’s highly competitive nature means that if your controllers can’t track these movements, you simply won’t be able to keep up.

Ready at Dawn stated they are “working closely together with Oculus to bring the highest quality tracking to Echo VR on the Rift S“. The developer explained the solution they’re working on:

The IMU is the chip within all VR controllers which is composed of a gyroscope and accelerometer. Normally, cameras and IMU work together to determine the controller’s position with sub-mm precision. When not in view of any camera however, the IMU output can still be used.

Based on Ready at Dawn’s description, they are seemingly using the accelerometer to determine how you are pushing or throwing when your hand is out of view. For example, if your hand was grabbed onto a wall behind you when tracked and then a strong acceleration is sensed in that direction, the game can determine that you’re trying to push off that wall.

We’ll make sure to do a thorough test whenever the patch with this functionality ships, but Ready at Dawn seems optimistic that it will work well.

Ready at Dawn also praised the IMU in the new Touch controllers, calling it “extremely innovative” (though we’re not sure exactly what that means).

The company suggested that it is superior to the IMU in the original Touch controllers, claiming that it actually enables better tracking of high speed movements:

This solution opens up the question of whether we could see Echo VR come to the Oculus Quest standalone headset one day. Quest has fewer cameras than Rift S and they’re positioned at the front corners, not the sides. So whether it could get Echo VR would seemingly depend on just how well this IMU prediction system works.

At Oculus Connect 5 back in September Ready at Dawn was listed as working on an Oculus Quest game or port. In January, the developer stated that they were “experiementing” with Oculus Quest, and that fans should “Keep an eye out for updates in the future.”

We don’t recommend getting your hopes up, but if the game did come to Quest it could easily be the headset’s flagship multiplayer title.",Here's How Echo VR Will Work With Oculus Rift S Inside-Out Tracking

We're now in Week 2 of the new season, and that means there's a new assortment of challenges for players to complete across PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. As usual, clearing this week's tasks will reward you with Battle Stars, which will in turn level your Battle Pass up and unlock the hot new Season 9 skins and rewards.

That's not all you can get by completing challenges, however. Epic has an extra reward in store for players who manage to finish all seven tasks from a given week: a special loading screen. These screens all feature a cool piece of artwork, but the real reason you want to get them is because they hold a clue pointing you to a free item hidden somewhere around the island.

In past seasons, completing all the even-number weekly challenges would give you a chance to collect a free Banner, which could be used as a profile icon. However, Epic is doing things a little differently this season. If you finish two weekly sets of challenges, you'll still unlock a special loading screen; however, this one won't point you to a free Banner, but rather a Fortbyte, a new type of collectible introduced this season. Fortbytes resemble small, glowing computer chips, and they can be found by meeting certain criteria, such as completing a certain number of challenges.

The reward for completing two weeks' worth of Season 9 challenges is the Neochasers loading screen pictured above. This time, however, the clue isn't hidden within the loading screen itself, but rather its description, which reads, ""Last seen at battling at Dino Park outhouse, these two can't be stopped."" That's where you'll find Fortbyte #13. Head south of Paradise Palms, near the three dinosaur statues, and find the port-a-potty there.

189,TECHNOLOGY,"The ""Now Network"" will begin to take pre-orders for its first two 5G-enabled devices tomorrow, May 17, with commercial availability then set for May 31 in four major cities. A slew of other early 5G markets are vaguely scheduled to join the ultra-high-speed party in the ""next few weeks"", but let us first focus on the 5G products Sprint is throwing in the arena against the (temporarily) Verizon-exclusive Galaxy S10 5G

As expected, the V50 ThinQ 5G that recently made its debut in Korea following a short ""optimization"" delay is slightly cheaper than Samsung's first 5G-capable smartphone, at a recommended retail price of $1,152. If that still feels a little rich for your blood, Sprint can hook you up with a massive ""limited time"" discount, letting you have this Snapdragon 855 beast at only $24 a month without needing to pay a dime upfront as long as you don't mind signing an 18-month lease.

That amounts to an incredibly affordable grand total of $432 (with monthly bill credits), although it's important to remember leasing a handset is not the same thing as owning it. That being said, 5G technology is widely expected to undergo some drastic changes over the next couple of years, so you might not want to hold on to the LG V50 for long anyway.

Right now, of course, the 6.4-incher is a pretty impressive slab with a large 4,000 mAh battery on deck, as well as three rear-facing cameras, two front-facing shooters, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage, and an optional dual display case that Sprint is oddly staying mum about. Perhaps it's not coming to the US?

Meanwhile, the HTC 5G Hub is also not what we'd call cheap, with a standard $600 price tag attached to its name, but you can get this bad boy at a hefty discount too with a two-year installment billing agreement. Specifically, you can pay $12.50 instead of $25 a month for a ""limited time"", totaling $300 after 24 installments. The smart hub packs a Snapdragon 855 SoC and Snapdragon X50 modem of its own, hiding quite a few neat tricks up its sleeve, including 4K video streaming capabilities to a second screen.

The HTC 5G Hub sports a 5-inch display of its own, allowing non-5G laptops, tablets, phones, and TVs to easily experience early Sprint 5G speeds.

Sprint's 5G revolution starts in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Kansas City on May 31, with availability soon to follow in (parts of) Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C. That's a relatively decent (and specific) list, although it's no match for Verizon's promise of rolling out mobile 5G services in over 30 US cities by the end of the year. Obviously, Sprint intends to bring its next-gen network to more people further down the line, but we don't know anything about that just yet.

The final and possibly most important piece of the 5G launch puzzle is the price of Sprint's ""plan of choice"" to be paired with the LG V50 ThinQ and, someday, the Galaxy S10 5G as well. You get not just unlimited 5G data, talk and text nationwide with Sprint's Unlimited Premium option, but also a bunch of extra perks like Hulu, Amazon Prime, Twitch Prime, Tidal HiFi, and 100GB LTE mobile hotspot. All for $80 a month for one line, which... doesn't really feel excessive. Sprint is claiming the bundle delivers a monthly value of ""nearly"" $150, which may well be true.

In contrast, Verizon's Above Unlimited plan costs $95 a month for a single line of service, with a $10 5G surcharge marked down to $0 at the moment if you buy a 5G phone from Big Red. Interestingly, Sprint is also offering a special $60 plan for the HTC 5G Hub with only 100 gigs of high-speed data included and a massive downgrade to 2G, yes, 2G taking place once you hit that ceiling.

Mere hours after Verizon kicked off actual Galaxy S10 5G sales and more than a month after Big Red flipped the 5G switch in parts of two markets for the Moto Z3 only, Sprint is finally following suit with a number of exciting related announcements",Sprint's first 5G devices get a release date and some killer introductory deals

191,TECHNOLOGY,"It would take 60 days in-hospital for Short to touch her nose with her left hand, and a full year before her arms had the strength to hold anything, let alone a camera. While she was there, her best friend gifted her an iPhone 4 because it was easier to use after her injury.

“It took about a year for me to have enough arm strength to start holding an iPhone,” Short recalls. “It was the first camera that I started using [after the accident], and now it’s the only camera that I’ve been using because it’s nice and light, small and easy to use.”

Since then, Short’s creative process has shifted to one that is digitally streamlined and mobile. “It used to be that I had my 4x5 camera, and I had my medium format camera and 35 mm and it got complicated,” she says. “Now it’s more about the image and less about the technical and the equipment. It’s made me more focused.”",Photographer Rachael Short explores the beauty of simplicity with iPhone
192,TECHNOLOGY,"Verizon is showing off download speeds using the newly-launched Galaxy S10 5G today, probably because they opened up the network a bit following a few weeks of testing. After peaking well under 1Gbps in early April, Verizon’s 5G network is now pushing beyond 1Gbps with Samsung’s new phone.

I’m guessing they needed to do this to try and keep up with the milestones that AT&T continues to brag about. In a world filled with stupid “firsts,” AT&T has already marched past 1Gbps and onto 2Gbps, though they don’t currently sell a phone that can do what Verizon’s S10 5G just did.

The speedtest below, which is run by Verizon’s George Koroneos, shows a top speed close to 1.1Gbps. That’s substantially faster than what we saw back during the initial launch in April using a Moto Z3 with attached 5G Moto Mod. Just keep in mind that these are tests on a network with almost no devices competing for bandwidth.

Wondering why the video cuts off just before showing the upload speeds? That’s because Verizon hasn’t enabled 5G uploads. Their 5G network still utilizes 4G LTE on the upload side of things.",Here is Verizon’s 5G Network Downloading at Gigabit Speeds
193,TECHNOLOGY,"John Robinson was born without the extensions of his arms or legs. As a child, and an adult, he rejected wearing prostheses. They worked, but they were uncomfortable, and he never felt like himself with them on. And that’s all Robinson really wanted to be, just himself.

It’s why he understands the frustrations many other people with disabilities face in trying to get people to see who they really are – especially when it comes to looking for employment. And why his organization, Our Ability, is among seven new recipients of Microsoft’s AI for Accessibility grants to people using AI-powered technology to make the world a more inclusive place.

In 2018, when the $25 million program was announced, nine organizations were given grants to work on a variety of projects, some from scratch, some already underway.

The new grantees, announced in conjunction with Global Accessibility Awareness Day May 16, are: University of California, Berkeley; Massachusetts Eye and Ear, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School; Voiceitt in Israel; Birmingham City University in the United Kingdom; University of Sydney in Australia; Pison Technology of Boston; and Our Ability, of Glenmont, New York.

Their projects may differ, but the people behind them share a passion for how technology can improve the lives of their fellow human beings.

“What stands out the most about this round of grantees is how so many of them are taking standard AI capabilities, like a chatbot or data collection, and truly revolutionizing the value of technology in typical scenarios for a person with a disability like finding a job, being able to use a computer mouse or anticipating a seizure,” says Mary Bellard, Microsoft senior accessibility architect.",Microsoft’s AI for Accessibility grant winners: ‘You want to be seen as the person you are’
194,TECHNOLOGY,"Facebook wants to keep News Feed relevant.

The social network is tweaking its News Feed algorithm to try and show more posts from your closest friends. In order to do that, though, the company is taking a somewhat new approach: asking users to straight-up tell them who their best friends are.

Facebook has always tried to predict who your closest friends are by looking at signals like who you interact with most often. But with the change, the company will start explicitly asking people who their best friends are to incorporate the information into their rankings.

""We’ve begun surveying people on Facebook to ask them to list the friends they are closest to,"" Facebook writes in a statement. ""We look at the patterns that emerge from the results, some of which include being tagged in the same photos, continuously reacting and commenting on the same posts and checking-in at the same places — and then use these patterns to inform our algorithm.""

The company says the change is meant to improve relevancy and that it ""doesn’t mean you will necessarily see more friend content.""

But the update does say a lot about how Facebook is thinking about the future of News Feed. Last month, the company showed off a redesigned app and website that places less emphasis on News Feed in order to show more content from Groups and Stories. And Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he believes Facebook users are increasingly moving toward sharing more private and ephemeral content.

That's a problem for News Feed, which was built around the idea of mass sharing. And while News Feed isn't going away any time soon, a shift toward more content from ""close friends"" could help it feel more relevant.",Facebook wants to know who your best friends are

198,TECHNOLOGY,"A couple of years ago on the Nintendo 3DS, the Pokémon franchise arrived with a new spin-off. Called Pokémon Rumble, the idea was to make pocket monster battling more dynamic and give it a toyetic spin at the same time. The end result was cute: Toy Pokémon, battling one another using a system of dynamic attacks that played to elemental type strength and weaknesses.

A few years later, and Nintendo is reviving that idea once again, only this time for mobile devices with Pokémon Rumble Rush. It’s currently available on Android phones if you happen to be in Australia (YouTube downvotes are just upvotes from Australia, just so you know), and it’ll have you flying around various islands and building up a gang of pocket monsters along the way. Simple!

The actual gameplay looks even more simple: Players can engage in some on-rails action, tapping on opposition Pokémon and using their chosen partner’s special attack to clear the way towards a final boss. Defeat the mightier Pokémon, earn some coin and maybe even a few captured Pokémon to add to your collection along the way.

To get stronger, you’re going to need to grind for Ore though, a precious stone that increases stats which in turn increases your overall Combat Power, sort of like how Pokémon Let’s Go used various candies to initiate a similar system of permanent power-ups. And that in turn, makes for an addictive groove. Hop to an island, battle your way through, take on the boss and get rewarded. Rinse and repeat.

The catch here is that each big boss happens to require that your team is up to scratch so that they can survive attacks from the HP-sponge, which in turn emphasises the basic gameplay grind of Pokémon Rumble Rush. It’s simple, kind of addictive and it looks as cute as can be. Which makes for a game that is the perfect antithesis to anyone who doesn’t want to have to go outside and actually expose themselves to the elements if they want to catch Pokémon. Right, Pokémon GO? Right.",Pokémon Rumble Rush is an easy and addictive pocket monster smartphone game
199,TECHNOLOGY,"Drones have been capable of avoiding stationary obstacles for years, but researchers at the University of Zurich are working to make them even better at dodging moving objects.

As part of an experiment, the researchers recently published a video that shows an autonomous drone ducking and dodging a soccer ball being thrown at it in multiple scenarios.

The experiment was part of a project by Davide Scaramuzza's Robotics and Perception Group at the University of Zurich, which recently published a paper that studies the effects that latency in perception can have on how quickly robots are able to navigate through an unfamiliar environment.

To validate their analysis, the researchers equipped a drone with ""event cameras"" that would enable it to detect and dodge objects thrown in its path, according to their white paper. The project was first reported by IEEE Spectrum, the online magazine for IEEE, a professional organization focused on engineering and applied sciences.

In the video, the drone can be seen dodging a soccer ball thrown from various angles. In one shot, it subtly tilts to the side to avoid the ball in real time, while another experiment later in the video shows it zipping upward so that the ball can pass underneath it. The experiment used event cameras, which are special types of sensors that are very sensitive to motion and can respond to changes in a scene within microseconds, IEEE Spectrum reported.

With drones now being used for everything from agriculture to package delivery, the ability to detect and avoid moving obstacles in real time is sure to be crucial. Check out the video below:",Watch this self-piloting drone effortlessly dodge a soccer ball being thrown at it in real time
200,TECHNOLOGY,"Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) recently posted its first-quarter earnings, and the results were a mixed bag. Its revenue rose 16% annually to 85.5 billion RMB ($12.7 billion), which missed expectations and marked its slowest growth rate since its IPO.

However, Tencent's net profit rose 17% to 27.2 billion RMB ($4 billion), beating estimates by 7.8 billion RMB. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes acquisitions, investments, and other one-time gains, its net profit rose 14% to 20.9 billion RMB ($3.1 billion).

Tencent's growth is decelerating, but its first-quarter numbers indicate that its core business is stabilizing. I own shares of Tencent, and I don't plan on selling my position anytime soon for three key reasons -- the recovery of its gaming business, the growth of its new fintech and business services segment, and its disciplined focus on profit growth.

Tencent's online gaming business, which generated a third of its first-quarter revenues, struggled with a nine-month freeze on new gaming approvals in China last year.

Regulators also refused to approve microtransactions for two of its licensed battle royale games, PUBG Mobile and Fortnite. Meanwhile, its aging flagship game Honor of Kings (also known as Arena of Valor) lost momentum with a 12% drop in monthly active gamers in March, according to Bernstein analyst David Dai.

The growth of PUBG Mobile overseas, fresh content for Honor of Kings, and the release of a new game, Perfect World Mobile, were the business's core growth engines during the first quarter. Unfortunately, a lack of new games still throttled the growth of its mobile and PC gaming businesses, and its total online gaming revenue fell 1% -- marking its third straight quarter of negative growth.

However, Tencent's gaming revenue rose 18% quarter over quarter -- with 11% growth in mobile gaming and 24% growth in PC gaming -- indicating that the business was finally recovering.

Two major tailwinds could help it keep growing -- the growth of Perfect World Mobile, which launched near the end of the first quarter, and Game for Peace, a new battle royale title that generated $14 million in in-app revenues within the first 72 hours, according to Sensor Tower.","Tencent Posts Its Slowest Sales Growth Ever, but I'm Not Selling"

203,TECHNOLOGY,"It took a significant chunk of the day for any of the eight-player groups streaming The Division 2’s new Operation Dark hours raid on Twitch to finally clear it. The POG clan, led by Division streamer and YouTuber Marcostyle, managed to knock off the final boss at 5:10 p.m.

In a lengthy stream of the franchise’s first raid, players struggled through several boss encounters inside the game’s recreation of a Washington, DC, airport, leading to a climactic battle on the tarmac outside. That last encounter involved a coordinated assault on a large transforming truck that would occasionally open up to launch waves of drones, exposing itself to attack.



“Just one more phase, guys,” Marcostyle said to his squadmates during one of many runs at the final boss. The team all died several times, and in the final attempt, only seven players were active in the game. After three hours of attempts on the last boss, it finally fell, five hours after the raid went live. (Destiny 2’s first raid fell in six hours.)



“There’s no way this is world’s first, dude,” he said before checking the leaderboard and giving out a cheer.



The people on his team were indeed listed as the first in the world to finish the raid. The game’s creators at Ubisoft have said that the first eight-player team to do so will have their player names posted permanently in the game’s version of the White House.

Upon completion, nearly 15,000 people were watching the stream.

“Ubisoft, if you’re watching this, more of this,” he said. “This was actually super-hard. This was way more than I expected. Good fucking job, guys.”



Within five minutes, a second squad finished the raid and a third five hours after that, according to the leaderboards Marcostyle was able to check during his stream (none of those teams showed up on the leaderboard we checked on an office PS4, but a game designer for the game did commend the team for being world’s first).

The raid had been anticipated by players since it was announced last year, but much of the game’s playerbase was infuriated by the news earlier this week that it would not support matchmaking. Despite a pledge in a Ubisoft promotional image that all of the game’s online activities would support matchmaking, players who wanted to experience the raid would have to manually link up with others.



In a stream promoting the raid this morning, members of the development team tried to justify the decision, largely on the grounds that the raid would ostensibly demand the kind of teamwork and communication that wouldn’t come easy with matchmade strangers.

They nevertheless indicated that at least a half-measure was on the way.



“It’s not going to be in now. Is it going to come?” Division community developer Hamish Bode said on the stream. “Are we going to have some solution where people who don’t want to have to go outside of the game to matchmake or to find a group can actually do that in the game?”



“Yes,” associate creative director Chadi El Zibaoui said. “So we’re working on it.” He added, “You need to be sure the team you are going to work with has microphones, speaks the same language, has the proper gear to support the team.”



While we weren’t able to watch the full stream, the encounters we saw did require teamwork to, say, draw the attack of a tough boss while squadmates shot at other targets in the room. In the final phase, players needed to interact with four smaller installations before getting the drone truck to open up. During the morning stream, one of the developers said at least four people would be needed to clear some of the raid’s challenges.



Throughout the morning, players and developers shared suggestions about how to find teammates for the raid. The game’s official Discord offered looking-for-group channels, while the staging area for the raid—a helicopter landing pad near the White House, which is one of the rare spots in the game where players can see each other—saw a trickle of players showing up, milling about, and possibly inviting each other to play.

During the morning’s developer stream, the game’s creators hinted at the meaning behind the raid’s “Dark Hours” name. It’s a nod to the airport’s name in real life, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Reagan wasn’t just president of the United States in the ’80s but also an actor for decades before that. In 1954, he starred in a made-for-TV movie called The Dark, Dark Hours. There’s no narrative connection, just a cool-sounding name. The Dark, Dark Hours turns out to have an unusual backstory of its own. According to a 2010 article in The Atlantic, the short was lost for several decades before being discovered by an NBC employee, and, in the rarest of sights, it stars two of the most famous actors of all time: Reagan and the then-little-known James Dean.",Division 2 Players Beat Game’s First Raid In Five Grueling Hours
204,TECHNOLOGY,"This week, Apple became the third streaming platform to launch its own marketplace for video subscriptions.

With Apple TV Channels, you can sign up for services like HBO and Showtime directly through the TV app on iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs. You don’t have to download separate apps to start using those services, and you can manage all their subscriptions through iTunes billing. Apple TV Channels also supports offline viewing on iOS, so you can download Game of Thrones episodes before your next flight.

Apple isn’t the first to provide a single access point for streaming video subscriptions. Amazon Channels has offered a similar service to Prime subscribers since late 2015, and Roku entered the fray with Premium Subscriptions in The Roku Channel earlier this year.

But in trying to simplify streaming video sign-ups, these “Channels” services have created new complications. Each service has a different set of features, along with different restrictions on which devices you can use. They can also be more expensive than individual apps that offer annual subscriptions. And because the biggest streaming services don’t support these Channels marketplaces at all, you still have to deal with multiple apps and billing systems in the end.

The main selling point of these “Channels” services is simplicity. If you’re on an Amazon Fire TV Stick, for instance, you can search for a show like Game of Thrones and sign up for HBO with just a few clicks. Everything goes through your Amazon account, so you don’t need to create a new password or enter any new billing information. You can then access HBO shows through the Fire TV or any other device that has Amazon’s Prime Video app. When you want to unsubscribe, Amazon’s Manage Your Prime Video Channels page lets you cancel multiple subscriptions from one place.

Roku’s Premium Subscriptions service is similar. Just open the free Roku Channel app on any Roku player, and then scroll down to the “Browse Premium Subscriptions” section, where you can subscribe to services like Starz, Epix, and HBO with whatever credit card Roku has on file. You can then watch those channels on any device with the Roku Channel app, which for now includes Roku players and smart TVs, Samsung TVs, iOS, Android, and the web. Roku’s account page provides a central location for cancelling subscriptions.

As for Apple, you can subscribe to services like HBO, Showtime, and Starz through the TV app on iOS, Apple TV, and Samsung smart TVs. Just scroll down to “Available Apple TV Channels,” and you can sign up with just your Apple ID. Cancelling subscriptions through iTunes is a bit tricky, but you can use this iOS shortcut to jump straight to the subscription management page on an iOS device.

While this is all great in theory, “Channels” marketplaces create a new layer of confusion when you’re trying to sign up for video services. To watch HBO on Apple TV, for instance, you can now subscribe through Apple TV Channels, Amazon Channels (via the Prime Video app), the standalone HBO Now app, or various live TV channel bundles that sell HBO on their own. The same is true on Roku, except with The Roku Channel instead of Apple TV Channels as an option.

With rare exceptions, none of these services talk to each other, either. An Amazon Channels subscription does not transfer over to Apple TV Channels or Roku Premium Subscriptions, which means you need to keep track of how you signed up for what, especially if you own different kinds of streaming devices. And while Amazon Channels subscribers can log into the HBO Now, Showtime Anytime, and CBS All Access apps, those are exceptions to the rule. None of Amazon’s other Channels let you log into individual apps, and neither Roku Premium Subscriptions nor Apple TV Channels allow for individual app logins at all.

I suspect a lot of folks will get tripped up by all this and wind up with duplicate subscriptions as a result. This even appeared to happen with a user on Reddit over the weekend after signing up for CBS All Access on a Fire TV, and then trying to log in on a Roku. The distinction between different versions of the same subscription will not be obvious to everyone.

Even if you’re good at keeping track of where your subscriptions reside, choosing one “Channels” service over another has consequences. If you subscribe to CBS All Access through Apple TV Channels, you won’t be able to watch on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, or Android TV, because Apple’s TV app isn’t on those platforms. (Apple says it’s releasing a TV app for Roku and Fire TV, but hasn’t said when.) And if you subscribe to Showtime through Roku Premium Subscriptions, you won’t be able to watch on Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, or Android TV.

Your choice of “Channels” service also affects which device features you can enjoy. With Amazon Channels on Fire TV, for instance, shows like Star Trek: Discovery will appear in the “Recents” row on the home screen, so you can quickly pick up where you left off, and you can launch episodes directly with Alexa voice commands. On Apple TV, however, you can’t use Siri voice commands to launch Amazon Channels shows, and on Roku, Amazon Channels shows don’t appear in search results at all. Signing up for All Access directly through CBS would allow you to use voice across all three platforms, but then you’d lose the “Recents” row integration on Fire TV.

The whole concept just makes a big mess out of what is already a potentially confusing situation, and it doesn’t help much in the end because most streaming services don’t support Channels anyway. Netflix still has its own app and billing system, as does Hulu, Amazon Prime, and every live TV streaming service.

Besides, most of the offerings in these Channels services aren’t that desirable. Outside of premium cable channels like HBO, Showtime, Starz, Epix, and CBS All Access, the vast majority of these “channels” are digital-only streaming services you’ve probably never heard of (who’s ready to pay for Echo Boom Sports?) or scraps from TV networks’ back catalog (NickHits, History Vault).

There is, however, a silver lining: With all these new subscription marketplaces comes the ability to burn up more free trials. Just sign up for a trial to HBO via Amazon Channels, cancel immediately, and enjoy your free week of binge-watching Barry. Rinse and repeat with Apple TV Channels and Roku Premium Subscriptions, and then move on down the line to other services like Showtime and Starz.

Don’t feel guilty about this, either; if TV networks and tech companies are going to introduce all this extra confusion into cord-cutters’ lives, they might as well pay for it.

This story has been updated to note that Amazon Channels allows logins to the CBS All Access app.

205,TECHNOLOGY,"AMD’s next generation of mainstream graphics cards finally has a release window, and yet we still don’t know what they’re going to be called. But one thing I do know is that if AMD goes with the rumoured RX 3080 XT branding it’s in danger of setting expectations too high, confusing the hell out of people, and setting itself up for a fall.

Dr. Lisa Su herself confirmed that the Navi GPUs would be released in Q3 of this year, something AMD reiterated in a recent investor presentation. That means we’ll have cards on the shelves, and in our test rig, sometime between July and the end of September. AMD has also announced it will be presenting the Next Horizon Gaming event at E3 where most of us are expecting the big Navi pre-release reveal to happen.

Which is all very exciting. New mainstream graphics cards tend to get me rather more hot under the collar than the super-expensive, super-powerful flagship GPUs. Those might as well be multi-million dollar supercomputers given how likely it is that any of us would ever be able to afford one ourselves.

But a great mid-range GPU can make a huge difference, both to the gaming community and to the manufacturer responsible. It can suddenly make performance only the gaming elite could previously experience possible at unprecedented price points. A quality mainstream card can also level the PC playing field, and make the ecosystem just that bit more accessible to mere mortals.

And, thanks to the increased volume of mainstream graphics cards, the bulk sales can quite the impact on a company’s bottom line.

Pixel pushers: The best graphics cards on the market today

This is why Navi is so exciting and so important. And that’s why I’m a little concerned about the rumoured RX 3000 naming scheme. The recent rumour from AdoredTV is that the Radeon RX 3080 XT will be based on the top-spec Navi 10 GPU, sport 56 GCN cores, 8GB GDDR6, and rock a 180W TDP.

And it will go head-to-head with an Nvidia RTX 2070 for around $300. Yes, for half the price of the current third-tier Turing graphics card.

Forgetting the extraordinary pricing for the moment, it’s the name that worries me. Especially given that we’re already being told that it’s going to be competing with an RTX 2070. Don’t get me wrong, the RTX 2070 is a powerful GPU, offering gaming performance just ahead of a GTX 1080.

If AMD’s mainstream graphics cards are able to perform in that weight class, then we could be in for a treat. But the name still suggests more.

The reasoning behind the rumoured naming scheme is that AMD wants to follow the same tit-for-tat nomenclature that it’s been using in its rivalry with Intel motherboard chipsets. While Intel was shipping Z270 boards for Kaby Lake, AMD released the X370 for the first-gen Ryzen CPUs, and by creating the B350 chipset it meant Intel had to change scheme and release a B360 mainstream board for its subsequent Coffee Lake generation.

The same happened with the Intel X299 and AMD X399 HEDT motherboards.

But in these instances things were more level, the nomenclature matched the rival company’s performance tiers and it still made some twisted sense. That won’t happen if AMD is choosing to use the RX 3000 code as some sort of shorthand for being better than an equivalent Nvidia card. We already know an RX 3080 XT isn’t going to be faster than an RTX 2080, even if it’s nominally 1000 better and comes with an extra ‘X’.

One thing that AMD always has to be careful of is managing the hype train. The expectations of the Radeon faithful have always been unerringly high, and that sometimes comes back to bite AMD in the posterior. Take Vega, for example, an architecture heralded as the great GPU hope for the company, based mostly on what the community wanted rather than what AMD itself had promised.

It failed to deliver on the sky-high expectations with Vega, as AMD failed to manage them ahead of launch. Going with this sort of aggressively competitive naming scheme could potentially push those expectations higher, especially with more casual PC hardware peops, leading to an unwarranted Navi backlash post-launch.

“An old RTX 2070 is as fast as my brand new, next-gen RX 3080, what gives?”

And if team Radeon is just picking the scheme so it can block Nvidia from using the RTX 3080 name for its next generation of graphics cards then that’s just kind of a dick move. To me, the rumoured nomenclature reads more like AMD Radeon fan-fiction, or a marketing team’s in-joke, than a genuine attempt at Nvidia-baiting.

There has though been the suggestion that AMD is seeking to more closely marry up its CPU and GPU divisions, two sides of the AMD coin that historically remained separate long after the 2006 ATI merger. Having Ryzen 3000 CPUs and Radeon 3000 GPUs sold together does at least make some sort of symmetrical sense, though an R7 3800X and an RX 3080 XT seem just a little too close for comfort to mine eyes.

Personally I don’t think AMD needs to enter into a nomenclature war on two fronts, battling both Intel on the chip side and Nvidia on the graphics seems like wasted effort. And if the pricing rumours are true – that AMD’s Navi will deliver the same performance as Nvidia cards, but at half the price – then why run the risk of confusing folk? Hell, at those prospective prices AMD could name the flagship Navi card RX Turd Sandwich XT and it would still sell by the boatload.

What is the real price of AMD’s Navi?

But are those prices realistic? Massively undercutting Nvidia would be a great way to boost AMD’s GPU market share… so long as the margins on the 7nm silicon are high enough to enable team red to manufacture a GPU with 3,584 GCN cores, with 8GB GDDR6 attached to it, and then still sell it for $300 without it being a loss-leader. Maybe the 7nm node is suddenly extremely affordable, and creating hot 180W GPUs doesn’t cost what it once did (five months ago).

Honestly I think that’s a hell of an ask, and historically, even when AMD has had some level of GPU performance parity with the competition, it has chosen to match pricing rather than undercut. You only need to think back as far as January and the release of the Radeon VII for the most recent example. That’s a GPU that could more or less keep up with an RTX 2080 yet AMD still chose to copy the overblown Nvidia pricing exactly.

But we don’t have long to wait now. There might be some news trickling out of the Computex show in a couple of weeks, with the Next Horizon Gaming event at E3 barely a week or so after that. Our Jacob will be on the ground at both events, so we’ll be able to bring you the full details as soon as they’re announced. We’re good like that.

I’m still hoping AMD sticks to the classics and brings us the Radeon RX 680 and RX 670, delivering us into a new world of high-performance mainstream cards that people can actually afford. Because that’s what potentially makes Navi exciting, not some sort of willy-waving fight over an ephemeral numerical codename advantage.",AMD launching Navi as an RX 3080 XT would be a dangerous game

209,TECHNOLOGY,"Over the last day, you may have noticed that several of your Facebook groups have switched their settings to “Secret,” for no apparent reason. That may have been to avoid the attentions of a particular virulent group inserting itself into other communities solely for the purpose of getting them banned.

According to KnowYourMeme, several public Facebook groups were being banned after a single member joined and began flooding them with non-standard-compliant images, then reporting the groups in order to get them banned. Most of the groups being targeted appear to be meme or “shitposting” groups, with one of the biggest being Crossovers Nobody Asked For, which has hundreds of thousands of members and still hasn’t come back at the time of writing.

Supposedly this is the work of a group called the Indonesian Reporting Commission, or at least one person associated with them. Since the groups who’ve been targeted are no longer accessible, this is difficult to confirm. Others claim the former leader was the one doing most of the reporting.

Whether that’s exactly true or just a rumor, several group admins changed their privacy settings to “Secret” in response. When a group goes secret, it means they can’t be found by public search, effectively screening them from anyone who’s not already a member. Trouble is, you can only change your settings, according to Facebook’s rules, once every 28 days, and you only have 24 hours to change them back after they’ve been changed — meaning, these groups could go dark, as it were, for a month just to avoid this problem.

Facebook‘s not exactly discerning when it comes to who to ban, and in this case I can’t say I blame them. Given how much negative stuff proliferates on Facebook on any given day, I’d probably ban first and ask questions later too. Nor would I blame the group admins — better safe than sorry.

Facebook users responded in a somewhat questionable fashion — specifically, they doxxed the apparent leader of this group, whose name we won’t repeat here but whom users claimed had a direct hand in the group shut-downs. Doxxing is bad, everyone, and we don’t condone it no matter who it is. An apology letter from this person is now making the rounds, in which he claims the reason he did it is to get back at these meme groups for hate speech and anti-religious posts.

Update (11:30AM CEST, May 17, 2019): A Facebook spokesperson told TNW it realized that the violative content posted to many Groups came from people who intended to sabotage said Groups, and as such, it’s bringing back the ones it removed in light of this incident. The company didn’t specify who was responsible, though.

211,BUSINESS,"Shares of Luckin Coffee surged as much as 50% Friday morning in the Chinese up-start retailer's Nasdaq debut.

The opening trade under the symbol LK was $25 per share. On Thursday night, Luckin priced its initial public offering at $17 per share, for an implied market value of roughly $4 billion. The Beijing-based chain also boosted its IPO to 33 million shares, 3 million more than initially planned. Its IPO price was on the high end of its expected range of $15 to $17 per share.

By early afternoon, its share price was $21.66, up 27%.

Luckin is trying to overtake Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in China. Since it was founded less than two years ago, it has opened 2,370 stores and plans to add 2,500 this year alone. Roughly 90% of its stores are smaller format shops designed for easy pickup and proximity to its customers, in contrast to Starbucks' larger and more homey cafes. Starbucks is celebrating its 20th anniversary in China this year.

""We have done what most people do in 15 or 20 years,"" Luckin CFO Reinout Schakel said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box "" ahead of the start of trading.

Coffee sales in China are expected to reach $8.2 billion this year, growing annually by 11.3% over the next five years, according to Statista. But tea still remains the top drink for Chinese consumers. Luckin is also trying to reach tea drinkers with trendy beverages, like fruit teas topped with cream cheese.

Luckin has also tried to attract new customers by discounting its drinks, a strategy that Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has said is not sustainable. But investors may disagree.

In 2018, the chain reported net sales of $125.3 million and a net loss of $241.3 million. Shareholders will want to see the company become profitable eventually. The $561 million Luckin raised through the IPO will help fund new stores, customer acquisition, tech investments and other general corporate purposes.

212,BUSINESS,"On May 7th, 2016, a 40-year-old man named Joshua Brown was killed when his Tesla Model S sedan collided with a tractor-trailer that was crossing his path on US Highway 27A, near Williston, Florida. Nearly three years later, another Tesla owner, 50-year-old Jeremy Beren Banner, was also killed on a Florida highway under eerily similar circumstances: his Model 3 collided with a tractor-trailer that was crossing his path, shearing the roof off in the process.

There was another major similarity: both drivers were found by investigators to have been using Tesla’s advanced driver assist system Autopilot at the time of their respective crashes.

Autopilot is Level 2 semi-autonomous system, as described by the Society of Automotive Engineers, that combines adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, self-parking, and, most recently, the ability to automatically change lanes. Tesla bills it as one of the safest systems on the road today, but the deaths of Brown and Banner raise questions about those claims and suggest that the Tesla has neglected to address a major weakness in its flagship technology.

There are some big differences between the two crashes

There are some big differences between the two crashes. For instance, Brown and Banner’s cars had completely different driver assistance technologies, although both are called Autopilot. The Autopilot in Brown’s Model S was based on technology supplied by Mobileye, an Israeli startup since acquired by Intel. Brown’s death was partly responsible for the two companies parting ways in 2016. Banner’s Model 3 was equipped with a second-generation version of Autopilot that Tesla developed in house.

That suggests that Tesla had a chance to address this so-called “edge case,” or unusual circumstance, when redesigning Autopilot, but it has, so far, failed to do so. After Brown’s death, Tesla said its camera failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky; the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) essentially found that Brown was not paying attention to the road and exonerated Tesla. It determined he set his car’s cruise control at 74 mph about two minutes before the crash, and he should have had at least seven seconds to notice the truck before crashing into it.

Tesla had a chance to address this so-called “edge case,” when redesigning Autopilot, but it has failed to do so

Federal investigators have yet to make a determination in Banner’s death. In a preliminary report released May 15th, the National Traffic Safety Board (NTSB) said that Banner engaged Autopilot about 10 seconds before the collision. “From less than 8 seconds before the crash to the time of impact, the vehicle did not detect the driver’s hands on the steering wheel,” NTSB said. The vehicle was traveling at 68 mph when it crashed.

In a statement, a Tesla spokesperson phrased it differently, changing the passive “the vehicle did not detect the driver’s hands on the steering wheel” to the more active “the driver immediately removed his hands from the wheel.” The spokesperson did not respond to follow-up questions about what the company has done to address this problem.

In the past, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has blamed crashes involving Autopilot on driver overconfidence. “When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,” Musk said last year.

The latest crash comes at a time when Musk is touting Tesla’s plans to deploy a fleet of autonomous taxis in 2020. “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything,” he said at a recent “Autonomy Day” event for investors.

Those plans will be futile if federal regulators decide to crack down on Autopilot. Consumer advocates are calling on the government to open up an investigation into the advanced driver assist system. “Either Autopilot can’t see the broad side of an 18-wheeler, or it can’t react safely to it,” David Friedman, vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports, said in a statement. “This system can’t dependably navigate common road situations on its own and fails to keep the driver engaged exactly when needed most.”

“Either Autopilot can’t see the broad side of an 18-wheeler, or it can’t react safely to it”

Car safety experts note that adaptive cruise control systems like Autopilot rely mostly on radar to avoid hitting other vehicles on the road. Radar is good at detecting moving objects but not stationary objects. It also has difficulty detecting objects like a vehicle crossing the road not moving in the car’s direction of travel.

Radar outputs of detected objects are sometimes ignored by the vehicle’s software to deal with the generation of “false positives,” said Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Without these, the radar would “see” an overpass and report that as an obstacle, causing the vehicle to slam on the brakes.

On the computer vision side of the equation, the algorithms using the camera output need to be trained to detect trucks that are perpendicular to the direction of the vehicle, he added. In most road situations, there are vehicles to the front, back, and to the side, but a perpendicular vehicle is much less common.

“Essentially, the same incident repeats after three years,” Rajkumar said. “This seems to indicate that these two problems have still not been addressed.” Machine learning and artificial intelligence have inherent limitations. If sensors “see” what they have never or seldom seen before, they do not know how to handle those situations. “Tesla is not handling the well-known limitations of AI,” he added.

Tesla has not yet explained in detail how it intends to fix this problem. The company releases a quarterly safety report about the safety of Autopilot, but that report is short on details. That means experts in the research community don’t have hard data that would allow them to compare the effectiveness of Autopilot to other systems. Only Tesla has 100 percent understanding of Autopilot’s logic and source code, and it guards those secrets closely.

“We need detailed exposure data related to when, where, and what conditions drivers are leveraging Autopilot,” said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist in the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, in an email to The Verge, “so that we can begin to better quantify the risk with respect to other vehicles of a similar age and class.”

Other Tesla owners have spoken out about Autopilot’s problem of perceiving trucks in the vehicle’s path. An anonymous Twitter user who uses the handle @greentheonly “hacked” a Model X and posts observations on Twitter and YouTube. They did this to “observe Autopilot from the inside,” they said in an email to The Verge. In March, their Model X encountered a tractor-trailer perpendicular to their path, similar to both Brown and Banner. The vehicle would have tried to drive underneath the truck had the driver not intervened.

According to @greentheonly’s data, the semi was not marked as an obstacle. But they decided not to tempt fate: “I did not try to approach the trailer and see if any of the inputs would change (but I bet not).”","Tesla didn’t fix an Autopilot problem for three years, and now another person is dead"
213,BUSINESS,"Walmart is getting new digs.

The biggest retailer in the world, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, is one step closer to moving into a new home office for more than 14,000 people, which will be outfitted with fitness centers for employees and their families, a child-care facility, more diverse dining options like food trucks, trails for hiking and biking, and tons of windows — yes, more windows. Walmart's current home office is notorious for lacking natural light.

Walmart's existing headquarters, built in 1971, is made up of more than 20 buildings scattered around the corner of Southwest Eighth Street and Walton Boulevard in Bentonville. The new space will be built along J Street, the company said when it first revealed its plans to move, in September 2017.

Walmart on Friday released a blog post with more details about the new office and photos offering a first look at the facilities, which will span more than 300 acres. Demolition of the existing buildings on that land is expected to start this summer, and construction of the new campus will begin over the next two years, with workers moving in phases, the company said.

Walmart said the goal of getting into more modern facilities with an open floor plan — and better food, parking and fitness options — is to ""attract the next generation of talent."" That's as Amazon — arguably Walmart's biggest rival in retail today — is embarking on opening a new headquarters in Virginia and another office space in Tennessee. (Amazon, which has its main headquarters in Seattle, was planning an office in New York City, but that fell through thanks to plenty of local opposition.)

For Walmart, though, the company didn't think about leaving its roots behind in Bentonville, Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of Walmart's corporate affairs team, said Thursday on a call with members of the media.

""This was not a hard decision for us to keep our home office in northwest Arkansas. ... We are a part of this community,"" he said. Walmart has been able to establish a presence in other cities across the U.S. through its acquisitions, like when it bought Jet.com, giving Walmart an office in Hoboken, New Jersey.

""Arkansas has been good to us, and there's nowhere else we'd rather call home,"" CEO Doug McMillon said.

Walmart's big move follows McDonald's opening a $250 million headquarters in Chicago's West Loop last year. The fast-food chain's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, sits on Walmart's board, and Bartlett said Walmart has taken some inspiration from that design, as well as from visits to other corporate offices such as Apple's and Deloitte's, and from college campuses.

The company hasn't announced the lead architect for this project. It also hasn't disclosed a price tag for the move. But Bartlett said it will fall into Walmart's ""typical annual budgeting process"" and that the company""feels good"" about the capital it has on hand to pursue this. Since the move is happening in phases, the expenses will be spread over the span of a few years, not hitting on a particular quarter all at once.

Walmart also is still deciding what will become of its current home office once everyone has moved out of those buildings. Bartlett said it's likely those buildings will be demolished, but the company will work with city and state leaders to turn the area into something the surrounding community can use.

""I think [our founder] Sam Walton himself would say: 'Don't conflate history with what needs to be done in the future,'"" he said. ""We are a company that is aggressively on the move as we continue to shape ... the future of retail.""

""We the public, we the people, developed this drug, we paid for this drug, we lead and developed all the grounding patents to create PrEP, and then that patent has been privatized despite the fact that the patent is owned by the public, who refused to enforce it,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

In prepared remarks, O'Day denied the charge that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, owns the patent for PrEP. ""Every single Gilead employee is proud that we invented Truvada, a medicine that can both treat and prevent HIV,"" he said.

""Our well-supported view is that the U.S. government does not hold valid patents on the use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, nor does it hold any patent for Truvada itself,"" O'Day added.

The hearing came as activists have ramped up pressure against Gilead, a company that commercializes and manufactures a variety of therapies and cures for chronic diseases.

Members of the PrEP4All Collaboration, a group of activists pushing for broad PrEP access, and legal experts filed a class action lawsuit on Tuesday alleging that the nation's largest HIV drug manufacturers, including Gilead, for years conspired to keep cheaper generic component medications out of popular ""combination pills"" that make treating HIV as simple as taking one pill a day.

215,BUSINESS,"NVIDIA made a huge effort pushing for the adoption of ray tracing throughout the games industry with the GeForce RTX line of graphics cards debuted in the second half of 2018.

While there wasn’t a lot of software support at first, adoption is now picking up across the industry and even Sony confirmed the next PlayStation 4 console will support ray tracing. In the latest NVIDIA conference call on Q1 2020 earnings, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang proudly boasted the company’s role in driving that adoption for everyone [ credits for this excerpt’s transcript go to Seeking Alpha ].

Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to ray tracing. And at this point, I think it’s fairly safe to say that that the leadership position that we’ve taken has turned into a movement that has turned next generation gaming ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have ray tracing and some of them already announced it and the partnerships that we’ve developed are fantastic. Microsoft DXR is supporting raytracing, Unity is supporting ray tracing, Epic is supporting raytracing with the Unreal Engine 4, leading publishers like Electronic Arts have adopted RTX and supported raytracing. Even movie studios, Pixar has announced that they’re using RTX and will use artifacts to accelerate their rendering of films. And so, Adobe and Autodesk jumped on to RTX and that will bring raytracing to their content and their tools. And so, I think at this point it’s fair to say that that raytracing is the next generation and it’s going to be adopted all over the world.

We’re expecting both NVIDIA and AMD to make new announcements on raytracing features and software support (chiefly games, of course) between COMPUTEX and E3 in the next few weeks. Wccftech will have teams on the ground at both conventions – stay tuned for exclusive coverage!","NVIDIA CEO: Our Leadership in Ray Tracing Turned It into a Standard, Almost Every Platform Will Have to Have It"
216,BUSINESS,"The current stock market sought direction Friday, as the major stock indexes moved from sharp losses to moderate gains, then back to light losses. But the market welcomed another IPO with enthusiasm.

A rebound in the stock indexes that began Tuesday is now coming up against renewed selling. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.3% and the S&P 500 was trading near the break-even level. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up around 0.2%.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were trying to stay above their 50-day moving averages, but struggled. On a positive note, stock indexes held near Thursday's lows. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is aiming to close above its 50-day line for a second day in a row.

Volume was tracking higher compared with the same time on Thursday on the NYSE and flat on the Nasdaq. Declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.

The energy, industrial, materials, transportation and technology sectors were lower. All those are sensitive to international trade, which has been a sore spot for the market this month.

On Friday, President Trump gave U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer 180 days to negotiate car import deals with Europe, Japan and other countries, a move that delays more tariffs. The delay was expected after reports earlier this week that the U.S. would hold off on car tariffs.

CNBC later reported that the U.S. agreed to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which removes a key obstacle to passing revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The market didn't move significantly on the news.

Retail was Friday's best sector. Department stores, specialty chains, drugstores, apparel and home furnishings retailers were among the 10 best industry groups. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) — whose equal-weighted holdings include Walmart (WMT) — was up 0.3%. The ETF is trading 4% below its 50-day average.

Walmart, which rose on better than expected fiscal Q1 earnings reported Thursday, was nearly flat after it erased losses this morning. Walmart stock is working on a flat base with a 104.28 buy point.

Luckin Coffee (LK) soared more than 50% after the China-based coffee chain went public on the Nasdaq at 17 a share. The IPO priced high in its expected range of 15 to 17. Luckin opened at 25 and traded as high as 25.96. But shares came down to a debut-session low of 20.60 shortly after 1 p.m. ET.

Luckin is taking on Starbucks (SBUX) in China's coffee retail market. Luckin follows other successful IPOs the past few months, including Tradeweb (TW), Zoom Video (ZM) and Beyond Meat (BYND).

217,BUSINESS,"New York (CNN Business) The No. 2 executive at Haven, the health care company backed by Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway, has left nine months after joining the fledgling firm.

Chief Operating Officer Jack Stoddard departed April 30 for personal reasons, a Haven spokesperson confirmed. The company hasn't named his replacement.

""Jack played an important role in the early stages of Haven, but we understand his decision to leave the company for family reasons,"" a spokesperson told CNN Business. ""We want to thank him for all of his contributions.""

Stoddard joined Haven in September 2018 from Comcast, according to his LinkedIn . Prior to that, he held various roles at other healthcare companies, includingGroup.

The Boston-based non-profit venture was formed in January 2018 by Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. It is led by Dr. Atul Gawande, a renowned surgeon and New Yorker writer, who was named CEO in June 2018

Haven aims to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and use and prescription drugs more affordable, the website says. It seeks to harness data and technology to make the overall health care system better.

One main goal is to give the three companies' combined 1.2 million employees and dependents better health care choices and bring down prices. Ultimately, the high-profile venture's work is intended to serve a wider audience.

There is enormous pressure on Haven to produce innovative ways to tackle the nation's longstanding problem of high health care costs, though it has been given time to develop solutions. Gawande and the venture's mega-rich leaders, who are known as disrupters, have released little information about the effort.","Haven, the Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan health care company, has already lost its No. 2 executive"

219,BUSINESS,"U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is reportedly in advanced-stage talks to buy cryptocurrency custody provider Xapo, for about $50 million. The deal’s goal would be to boost its custody business and diversify revenue sources

According to a report by crypto news outlet TheBlock, citing sources familiar with the matter, both Coinbase and Fidelity Digital Assets were ‘locked in a neck-and-neck race’ for the crypto custody firm, and Coinbase ended up coming out on top.

Fidelity Digital Assets is Fidelity Investments’ bet to bridge crypto and traditional finance. The firm is reportedly going to start buying and selling the flagship cryptocurrency bitcoin within “a few weeks.” Fidelity Investments is notably one of the largest financial firms in the world, with $7.2 trillion worth of assets under management (AUM).

Coinbase beating Fidelity to the Xapo sale, per the news outlet, shows the cryptocurrency firm is looking to “aggressively diversify its revenue to be less prone to the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency trading.”

Xapo itself has raised a total of $40 million since 2012, and its main product is cold storage vault custody of BTC. According to the report it has $5.5 billion of assets under custody (AUC), which means it has over 700,000 BTC under custody. Bloomberg has in the past reported the company held $10 billion, 7% of BTC’s supply, in its vaults.

The crypto custody firm’s business model revolves around generating revenue enabling over-the-counter (OTC) trades for customers using the bitcoin it has under custody, as it doesn’t charge users to store their funds in its cold storage.

The company has seen firms like the Digital Currency Group, Winklevoss Capital, and Blockchain Capital invest in it, as well as top Silicon Valley VC firms like Greylock Partners and Index Ventures.

If the deal goes through, Xapo will join a number of companies Coinbase has acquired over the last few months. These include Earn and Toshi, which turned to Coinbase Earn and Coinbase Wallet. Earlier this year the firm acquired analytics company Neutrino in a controversial move, as its team was associated with Hacking Team, a group that’s said to have developed software that aided human rights abuses.",Coinbase Reportedly in Advanced Talks to Acquire Xapo’s Crypto Custody Business
220,BUSINESS,"To Improve Health, Cut Costs, Walmart Pushes For Better Medical Imaging For Workers

Walmart Inc., the nation's largest private employer, is worried that too many of its workers are having health conditions misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary surgery and wasted health spending.

The issue crystallized for Walmart officials when they discovered about half of the company's workers who went to the Mayo Clinic and other specialized hospitals for back surgery in the past few years turned out not to need those operations. They were either misdiagnosed by their doctor or needed only non-surgical treatment.

A key issue: Their diagnostic imaging, such as CT scans and MRIs, had high error rates, says Lisa Woods, senior director of benefits design for Walmart.

So the company, whose health plans cover 1.1 million U.S. employees and dependents, has recommended since March that workers use one of 800 imaging centers identified as providing high-quality care. That list was developed for Walmart by Covera Health, a New York City-based health analytics company that uses data to help spot facilities likely to provide accurate imaging for a wide variety of conditions, from cancer to torn knee ligaments.

Although Walmart and other large employers in recent years have been steering workers to medical centers with proven track records for specific procedures such as transplants, the retail giant is believed to be the first to prod workers to use specific imaging providers based on diagnostic accuracy — not price, say employer health experts.

""A quality MRI or CT scan can improve the accuracy of diagnoses early in the care journey, helping create the correct treatment plan with the best opportunity for recovery,"" says Woods. ""The goal is to give associates the best chance to get better, and that starts with the right diagnosis.""

Walmart employees are not required to use those 800 centers, but if they don't use one that is available near them, they will have to pay additional cost sharing. Company officials advise workers that they could have more accurate results if they opt for the specified centers.

Studies show a 3% to 5% error rate each workday in a typical radiology practice, but some academic research has found mistakes on advanced images such as CT scans and MRIs can reach up to 30% of diagnoses. Although not every mistake affects patient care, with millions of CT scans and MRIs done each year in the United States, such mistakes can have a significant impact.

""There's no question that there are a lot of errors that occur,"" says Dr. Vijay Rao, chairwoman of radiology at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.

Errors at imaging centers can happen for many reasons, Rao says, including the radiologist not devoting enough time to reading each image, the technician not positioning the patient correctly in the imaging machine or a radiologist not having sufficient expertise.

Employers and insurers typically do little to help patients identify which radiology practices provide the most accurate results. Instead, employers have been focused on the cost of imaging tests. Some employers or insurers require plan members to use free-standing outpatient centers rather than those based in hospitals, which tend to be more expensive.

Woods says Walmart found that deficiencies and variation in imaging services affected employees nationwide. ""Unfortunately, it is all over the country. It's everywhere,"" she says.

Walmart's new imaging strategy is aligned with its efforts over the past decade to direct employees to select hospitals for high-cost health procedures. Since 2013, Walmart has been sending workers and their dependents to select hospitals across the country where it believes they can get better results for spine surgery, heart surgery, joint replacement, weight loss surgery, transplants and certain cancers.

As part of its ""Centers of Excellence"" program, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retail giant picks up the tab for the surgeries and all related travel expenses for patients on the company's health insurance plan, including a caregiver.

Most consumers give little thought to where to get an MRI or CT scan, and usually go where their doctors send them, the closest facility or, increasingly, the one that offers the lowest price, notes Covera CEO Ron Vianu. ""Most people think of diagnostic imaging as a commodity, and that's a mistake,"" he says.

Vianu says studies have shown that radiologists frequently offer different diagnoses based on the same image taken during an MRI or CT scan. Among explanations are that some radiologists are better at analyzing certain types of images — like those of the brain or bones — and sometimes radiologists read images from exams they have less experience with, he says.

Covera has collected information on thousands of hospital-based and outpatient imaging facilities.

""Our primary interest is understanding which radiologist or radiology practices are achieving the highest level of diagnostic accuracy for their patients,"" says Dan Elgort, Covera's chief data science officer.

Covera has independent radiologists evaluate a sampling of patient care data on imaging centers to determine facilities' error rates. It uses statistical modeling along with information on each center's equipment, physicians and use of industry-accepted patient protocols to determine the facilities' rates of accuracy.

Covera expects to have about 1,500 imaging centers in the program it runs for Walmart by year's end, says CEO Ron Vianu.

There are about 4,000 outpatient imaging centers in the United States, not counting thousands of hospital-based facilities, he estimated.

As a condition for participating in the program, each of the imaging centers has agreed to routinely send a sampling of their patients' images and reports to Covera.

Rao applauded the effort by Walmart and Covera to identify imaging facilities likely to provide the most accurate reports. ""I am sure centers that are worried about their quality will not be happy, but most quality operations would welcome something like this,"" she says.

Consumers have little way to distinguish the quality of care from one imaging center to the next. The American College of Radiology has an accreditation program but does not evaluate diagnostic quality.

""We would love to have more robust ... measurements"" about the outcomes of patient care than what is currently available, says Dr. Geraldine McGinty, chair of the college's board of chancellors.

Facilities typically conduct peer reviews of their radiologists' patient reports, but there is no public reporting of such results, she says.

Covera officials says they have worked with Walmart for nearly two years to demonstrate they could improve the quality of diagnostic care its employees receive. Part of the process has included reviewing a sample of Walmart employees' health records to see where changes in imaging services could have caught potential problems.

Covera says the centers in its network were chosen based on quality; price was not a factor.

In an effort to curtail unnecessary tests, Walmart, like many large employers and insurers, requires its insured members to get authorization before getting CT scans and MRIs.

""Walmart is on the leading edge of focusing on quality of diagnostic imaging,"" says Suzanne Delbanco, executive director of the Catalyst for Payment Reform, an employer-led health care think tank and advocacy group.

But Mark Stolper, executive vice president of Los Angeles-based RadNet, which owns 335 imaging centers nationally, questions how Covera has enough data to compare facilities. ""This would be the first time,"" he says, ""I have seen or heard of a company trying to narrow a network of imaging centers that is based on quality instead of price.""

Woods says that even though the new imaging strategy is not based on financial concerns, it could pay dividends down the road.

""It's been demonstrated time and time again that high quality ends up being more economical in the long run because inappropriate care is avoided, and patients do better,"" she says.","To Improve Health, Cut Costs, Walmart Pushes For Better Medical Imaging For Workers"

222,BUSINESS,"By the Sure Dividend staff

Real Estate Investment Trusts, also called REITs, are very popular among income investors. There is good reason for this. REITs are arguably the best way for investors to benefit from owning real estate, without having to purchase physical properties.

In addition, REITs are especially attractive for income. With the S&P 500 Index yielding ~2% on average, and further interest rate hikes having been put on hold for the time being, high income is hard to find. Fortunately, many REITs have high yields of 5% or more. You can see our full list of 5%+ yielding dividend stocks here.

In this article we will discuss three high-yield REITs with promising total return potential: Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH), Brookfield Property Partners/REIT (BPY)/(BPR), and Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT). While not without risks, we believe that these REITs present investors with attractive total return potential by combining a relatively favorable macroeconomic environment, with the advantages that REITs possess and sizable discounts to their underlying net asset values.

Interest rates appear to be peaking for the foreseeable future (though longer term, they will likely eventually go up again at some point) and global economic growth seems to be slowing down. These observations are confirmed by projections from the Federal Reserve and numerous other well-respected economists that economic growth is projected to slow over the next several years, with some even calling for a recession to hit sometime in the next few years.

The warning signs that this could become a reality include data from major U.S. trading partners showing signs of slowing, if not shrinking economic activity. This list includes much of Europe (in particular Italy, which is already in recession) as well as Asian powerhouses Japan and China. Given these countries' significant ties to the U.S. economy, it is only a matter of time before these trends hit American shores. The only reason it likely hasn't yet is due to the still-rippling boost from the 2018 tax cuts as well as the significant roll back of regulations from the Obama era.

The recently escalated trade war with China is also an item of major concern, as ever higher tariffs get slapped on each country's exports to the other's ports. Given the hundreds of billions of dollars that pass between the two countries each year, the impact of this disruption will be more than minor, and could plunge one or both economies into full recessionary mode if left unchecked over a prolonged period of time.

Finally, thanks to over a decade of quantitative easing and artificially low interest rates from the Federal Reserve, household, corporate, and government debt levels have spiked to new record highs. This has created a bubble like economy where growth and profits have been juiced by applying excessive amounts of cheap capital while discouraging savings. As a result of this environment - which has pushed asset valuations ever higher - investors have had to allocate capital to increasingly risky assets in order to maintain their previous levels of profitability. In the process, economic calculation has been disrupted due to market-level capital costs and consumer demand being artificially tampered with by government/central bank planners. The result is a fragile economy and capital market that is highly sensitive to even modest interest rate increases.

Due to these factors, the Federal Reserve will be forced to keep interest rates close to their current levels. However, if/when a global recession hits and/or malinvestment reaches a point that leads to a bursting of the bubble and a meltdown in the United States, the Federal Reserve will likely have to return to quantitative easing and cutting interest rates once again.

Since investors in general will likely become more worried about future growth and see more value in defensive, China trade-independent real asset investments, we expect the current macroeconomic environment to favor real estate and other more defensive high yielding investments. In such an atmosphere, we expect most of the returns to come from income rather than growth, which bodes very well for higher yielding real estate.

Given the tailwinds for real estate in this environment, real estate investment trusts (otherwise known as ""REITs"") are a particularly advantageous way to invest in the sector. This is because, relative to owning a small concentrated portfolio of individual rental properties, REITs involve considerably less risk.

First, REITs enjoy far superior liquidity since they can be traded in a click of a mouse at a very low (potentially zero depending on the brokerage) transaction cost as opposed to all of the time and expense that goes into selling a physical property.

Second, REITs have far less cash flow risk since REITs are widely diversified with 100s if not 1000s of properties and tenants, many of which are investment grade. In contrast, individual rental properties are often concentrated in much fewer tenants, thereby posing the risk of turning into cash burning liabilities if a vacancy occurs. REITs also enjoy less liability risk since shareholders cannot be sued directly, only the company itself. Rental investors on the other hand can be sued directly by tenants.

REITs are also totally passive investments whereas landlording physical properties requires a significant investment of time and effort. REITs - due to economies of scale - also typically enjoy far lower maintenance and capital/financing costs than investing in a small portfolio of rental properties as a private investor. Finally, and most importantly, REITs often enjoy considerably greater geographic and property diversification than a private investor can achieve on his own, setting the investment up for greater long-term risk-adjusted returns.

Indeed, these qualitative advantages have proven themselves to be decisive over the long term. According to a study by Cambridge Associates, over the past quarter century, REITs have returned more than 11% per year while private equity real estate investments returned just 7% on average, a ~400 basis point annual underperformance.

In fact, REITs have also handily outperformed the broader stock market over the long term. The Vanguard REIT index fund (VNQ) generated up to 4x higher total returns than the S&P 500 from 1997 until 2016:

Given that REITs are in general a superior investment to alternatives in and outside of real estate and that the environment seems particularly favorable right now, the ability to capitalize on stock market volatility to buy them at a discount to their private market value, or NAV, can juice returns even further. Here are three REITs trading at steep discounts to NAV that offer particularly promising total return potential right now.

SNH is a REIT that was founded in Maryland in 1998. The trust specializes in senior care facilities from housing to skilled nursing to medical offices and labs. Senior Housing owns almost 400 health-care real estate assets around the country. The assets are categorized into medical office buildings, triple net leased senior living communities, managed senior living communities and wellness centers. The first three categories make up 89% of operating income.

Recent Performance: Senior Housing reported Q1 2019 results on May 9, 2019. Q1 normalized FFO came in at 37 cents per share, down significantly from 45 cents per share in the year-ago quarter and missing the consensus estimate by 1 cent. Q1 total revenue of $266.3M also trailed the consensus estimate of $268.2M and was down from $275.8M a year earlier. The dismal results didn't stop there, Q1 same-property cash basis NOI fell 8.6% year-over-year, as a slight increase in same-store NOI in total medical office buildings (up 0.8%) was overwhelmed by the steep declines seen in the senior living communities (down 16%).

The company also began its disposition program where is plans to sell up to $900M of assets in connection with restructuring its business arrangements with Five Star Senior Living. Thus far this year, SNH has sold or has agreed to sell 35 properties for total expected proceeds of $64M.

Bull Case: While its recent results have been poor, everything is a good investment at the right price. In the case of SNH, its valuation has reached a point where it has truly become highly compelling at ~5x FFO which is half of our estimated fair value P/FFO multiple of 10x. As a result, despite recently cutting its dividend to a much more sustainable level, it still yields 7.25%. Even assuming no FFO/share growth over the next five years, multiple expansion back towards our fair value estimate should provide a 15% annualized tailwind to total returns, while the dividend yield will add an additional 7.25%. In all, SNH appears poised to return 22.25% annualized returns over the next half decade from deep value current pricing.

We believe this recovery in the valuation and the sustainability of current FFO/share and the dividend payout are all possible because of the influx of baby boomers reaching their latter years of retirement, when demand for senior care and housing is expected to surge (a demographic phenomenon commonly referred to in the industry as ""the silver wave"").

As a result, long-term demand for SNH's services will continue to increase for many years. The company is also a player in medical office buildings, which also have long-term increasing demand and have shown positive same-store growth in recent quarters, helping to offset the current negativity in senior housing.

Another reason we believe that the total return potential is not a pipe-dream is that, for a company trading at a ~20% cash flow yield, it has a decent balance sheet (near investment grade at BB+ credit rating). The company has over a quarter billion dollars of liquidity (with a market cap of under $2 billion) and recently unencumbered several properties while also paying off $400 million of senior notes. Their debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR is 6.7x and debt-to-gross assets is 42.3% and plan to use their disposition program to deleverage the balance sheet to below 6.0x by year end. As a result, it should be in solid shape to weather the near term challenges until the tailwind from the ""silver wave"" enables them to gain back the cash flow they will lose from dispositions, leading to multiple expansion.

An additional benefit of the disposition program is that it will likely be selling properties at valuations that exceed the implied net asset value given by SNH's current share price. As a result, these sales should help unlock value for shareholders.

A final reason SNH shares hold promise for strong returns is due to their geographic diversification across 42 states and the District of Columbia.

This diversification should make them more resilient and stable. Given that their shares are priced so cheaply at the moment, the more stable their cash flows moving forward, the more likely their shares are to deliver outstanding returns.

The Bear Case: While SNH has a fairly strong long-term record of growth (revenue has increased at an average annual rate of 19% during the past decade), it has not translated into per-share FFO growth. One culprit is a rising share count, which provides a long-term headwind to per-unit FFO growth. In addition, rising interest expense continues to eat into profits, as well as poor performance of the senior managed care communities. As a result of low FFO growth rates, a high current payout ratio, and poor performance of its senior living communities (in particular at its largest tenant, Five Star Senior Living), the REIT has not only failed to increase its distribution since 2013, it recently cut its dividend.

This dividend cut came as a result of the necessity to give Five Star Senior Living a huge rent cut from $17.4 million annually to just $11 million annually (a 38% reduction) in order to support its ongoing viability. Furthermore, the structure of the leases have been changed from master to management. This means that SNH now has a share in the profits and losses at the properties while Five Star earns a fee for operating and managing the properties. As a result, their cash flow stability will very likely decline along with greater downside (and upside) potential.

BPY was formed in 2013 as one of BAM's limited partnerships. While this means it issues a K-1 (as a Bermuda-based LP), there are two reasons that Brookfield Property appeals to those that typically reject such investments. First, it does not generate UBTI, making the units suitable for inclusion in a retirement account.

Second, Brookfield recently started offering a REIT alternative, known as Brookfield Property REIT which does not issue a K-1. They will each offer identical distributions/dividends both in terms of quantity and schedule.

BPY not only owns primarily office and retail properties but also invests opportunistically in multifamily, logistics, hospitality, self-storage, and student housing properties.

BPY's office portfolio consists of 288 office properties totaling approximately 138 million square feet in many of the world's premier cities. Combined with the Brookfield brand, this vast global network gives them pricing power alongside consistently strong occupancy and NOI growth relative to other office REITs.

Their high-quality retail portfolio contains world-class properties in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, and Asia. With 100 of the top 500 malls in the U.S., these properties are far from dead and dying and attract some of the best tenants while retaining strong pricing power (high teens leasing spreads over the past year, leading other industry peers).

Furthermore, no single tenant accounts for even 4% of total rent and the average remaining lease term is ~6.5 years, giving them significant diversification and cash flow visibility. Finally, BPY believes it can unlock considerable value by leveraging its business network, operational expertise, superior access to low-cost capital, and development acumen by repositioning and repurposing several of the properties with the long term in view. These qualities give it a competitive advantage over many retail REITs.

Recent Performance: BPY/BPR reported Q1 results on May 6th and Q1 FFO and realized gains per unit came in at 38 cents, flat year-over-year. The company saw strong gains from realizations in its LP Investment strategy, increased investment in core retail vs. the year-ago period, and continued same-property growth in its core office operations. However, the results were flat year-over-year due to higher interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar, and a higher unit count (due to the GGP acquisition). Core office operations generated company FFO of $140M in Q1 vs. $153M in the year-ago period (the decline was due to dispositions), core retail operations generated company FFO of $184M in Q1 vs. $116M in the year-ago period (due to same-store growth plus the GGP acquisition), and LP Investments company FFO of $146M increased from $96M a year earlier (due to increased investments and gain realizations).

Bull Case: One of the biggest competitive advantages that BPY enjoys is that BAM owns the majority of BPY's units. As a result, it provides BPY with exclusive access to a huge deal flow through its enormous global network. Additionally, BPY benefits from BAM's strong management and institutional expertise obtained over decades of managing and owning real estate.

By acquiring quality assets at what it believes to be attractive valuations and then adding value through its operational and development expertise, BPY aims to generate long-term returns of 12-15%. Management also enhances returns by routinely selling assets at rich valuations and recycling the capital into higher yielding opportunities in order to repeat its virtuous cycle of value-add operations and dispositions.

Another way in which management expects to drive superior returns over the long term is through its geographic and asset class diversification, giving BPY significant opportunities to continuously deploy capital into attractive markets. It also tends to level overall operating results similar to how a diversified stock portfolio experiences less volatility over time. Furthermore, management leverages its Brookfield connections in order to give it informational and bargaining advantages, enabling it to get superior values on its acquisitions and dispositions.

Another major argument for longs is the fact that BPY's distribution is very attractive. With a distribution yield of ~6.7% backed by 5 straight years of growth, it packs a powerful punch as a dividend growth stock. With another five years of growth, it will become a member of the Dividend Achievers, a select group of stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the full list of Dividend Achievers here.

Given our positive growth outlook for the company, BPY will very likely get there. The company has a target of achieving a 5-8% long-term distribution growth rate, but we believe it will likely come in around 5% per year over the next half-decade since the payout ratio is currently quite high (~85%) and the company is planning to allocate capital towards deleveraging and repurchasing units. We expect the annual FFO/unit growth rate to come in at around 6% per year over that time period, gradually driving down the payout ratio.

While BPY's debt to EBITDA ratio is well over 10x (making it one of the most leveraged real estate investments available in public markets), the structure of that leverage is conservative enough for it to maintain a solid BBB credit rating. 95% of the debt is in the form of non-recourse and self-amortizing mortgages. Additionally, the debt to asset ratio is only a little over 50%, which is pretty average for a REIT. This means that the reason the leverage ratio is so high is due to the low cap rate nature of the properties rather than the fact that the company has a high amount of debt relative to its real estate holdings. The reason that the cap rates are so low is because the properties are of such high quality. As a result, they enjoy strong occupancy and growth rates, further reducing their debt risk profile as they are more likely to weather a recession and, therefore, be better able to service their debt payments.

Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of an investment in BPY is that it appears undervalued based on numerous metrics. First, BPY's current NAV (IFRS accounting) per unit valuation is ~$29 (recently, validated by billions of dollars of dispositions in 2018 and Q1 2019 at prices above IFRS valuations), meaning that unit-holders have the opportunity to purchase equity in its high-quality and well-diversified portfolio at a steep discount. Management has recently reaffirmed its conviction in its steep discount by repurchasing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of units.

Additionally, using the dividend growth rate model and our estimate of 6% annualized FFO/unit growth over the next half-decade in combination with its 6.7% yield, we project 12.7% total returns. Adding on top of that our expectation that commitment to unit buybacks from management will yield multiple expansion to 16.4x FFO from the current 12.7x FFO, adding nearly 600 basis points to projected annualized total returns. This results in a market-beating 18.7% annualized total return projected over the next five years. Therefore, our view that BPY is materially undervalued seems to have a significant margin of safety.

Bear Case: One of the factors tempering demand for units is the recent GGP acquisition. Due to the market's general wariness of U.S. retail real estate, many investors prefer to steer clear of BPY units. However, we believe that with the deal in the rear view mirror and the dust settling, investors will begin to overcome their initial reservations as they see the tremendous value proposition in these units.

The most significant risks in our mind, however, stems from BPY's extremely high leverage as well as its exposure to international currency and geopolitical risks. However, as previously mentioned when we discussed the balance sheet, there are several caveats that keep us highly optimistic about the safety of this investment. As management executes on its deleveraging plan, we expect shares to be increasingly viewed favorably by investors.

Finally, the geopolitical/macroeconomic risk that comes with its global portfolio is mitigated by the fact that most of the economies in which Brookfield operates continue to be strong/strengthening, liquidity remains plentiful, interest rates remain low and the flattening yield curve portends low upside for further rate increases, leasing contracts typically have inflation increases built in to them, only 26% of assets are generating rent in foreign currencies, and BPY employs currency hedges to further reduce this exposure.

SKT is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. SKT operates and owns, or has a stake in, a portfolio of 40 upscale outlet shopping centers. SKT owns properties across 20 states and in Canada, totaling 14.4 million square feet. SKT leases to over 2,900 stores operated by over 500 different brand name companies. More than 189 million shoppers frequent Tanger Outlet Centers every year. SKT is headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. Tanger Outlet Centers are known for their tenant mix comprised of leading designer and brand-name manufacturers.

Recent Performance: SKT released first quarter results on May 6th, 2019 and announced funds from operations (FFO) of $0.57 per share, compared to $0.60 per share in the same period of last year. EPS for Q1 was $0.66 per share, compared to $0.24 per share last year, due to a gain on the sale of four outlet centers which added $0.44 per share. Funds available for distribution (FAD) were $0.54 per share, covering the dividend securely with a payout ratio of 65%. Consolidated portfolio occupancy rate were down by 0.5% from last year to 95.4%. Portfolio NOI decreased 0.8% for the quarter, but same center NOI was down slightly less by 0.5%. SKT completed the sale of four non-core outlet centers for $130.5 million. These properties represented 6.8% of the consolidated portfolio's square footage and 5.1% of its forecasted Portfolio NOI. SKT sold these properties as they were declining assets and did not expect them to achieve the portfolio's long-term growth. The cash was used to repay outstanding balances on the line of credit and management is considering increasing share repurchases with some of the freed line availability

Bull Case: As with the previous two examples, the valuation is quite compelling here. SKT offers a dividend yield of 7.7% and we estimate that between 4% average annual FFO/share growth and multiple expansion back closer to recent historical averages, shares should appreciate on average 11.5% per year over the next half decade. All told, shares could return 19% per year during that time span.

The confidence in the bounce back in share prices is based on the fact that the current occupancy and pricing power struggles at SKT is only temporary. The company will bounce back because of its long track record of success that has made it a Dividend Aristocrat (over 25 years of dividend growth; see our complete list and guide to the Dividend Aristocrats here), the strength of its outlet center business model, its fortress balance sheet, and deep discount to NAV.

As the only pure-play outlet center REIT in the world, SKT has benefited from the strong historical performance of this type of property. This business model cuts out the middleman and allows manufacturers to directly distribute to consumers. Therefore, Tanger has zero exposure to struggling department store operators and instead deals directly with strong and growing brands like Nike (NKE) and Gap (GPS) while also mixing in dining and entertainment to keep its properties fresh and attractive.

These qualities give it a low cost of capital and plenty of liquidity with which to re-invest in its properties to reboot its business performance. As a result, when combined with its historical recession resilience and low tenant cost relative to competing retail models, SKT will be able to survive and eventually thrive while other bricks-and-mortar retailers die off as its outlet centers reinvent themselves into combined dining and entertainment centers alongside valued parts of the emerging omnichannel retail model.

Shares also trade at a huge discount to their historical averages, trading at just 8x FFO and a ~25% discount to NAV. As already mentioned, the current dividend yield is also very attractive and well covered by FFO and supported by a strong balance sheet. Therefore, an investment in SKT today has a huge margin of safety.

Bear Case: The primary thesis of bears is that due to the rapid changes in the retail industry, the outlet center model is going obsolete, or at least suffering from a significant role reduction. As a result, occupancy rates, pricing power, and most of all, growth will decline in the years to come in search of a new (and much lower) equilibrium.

This is evidenced by the facts that few new development opportunities remain today, tenant occupancy costs are rising, rental spreads are turning negative, and same-store NOI is trending negative even as e-commerce, some other bricks-and-mortar retail properties, and the overall economy are all booming.

Furthermore, the outlet model's role as the method of choice by which national brands moved surplus or lower quality inventory is being displaced by e-tailers and other discount retailers like TJ Maxx (TJX) and Ross (ROST).

Another factor that will hurt SKT's ability to reinvent its properties is the fairly poorly located real estate it owns. Outlets are typically built in more rural areas where land is cheap and competition with other developers is lower. As a result, it may be hard to attractive alternative tenants and customers to the tenants outside of traditional outlet shoppers.

Finally, if you look out over the next several years, you will see that a large percentage of their leases are expiring. This could not come at a worse time given that a recession might be looming on the horizon and the REIT's pricing power is already at its worst point in a long time (if not ever).

Further compounding their problems is the fact that their largest tenant (Ascena Retail (ASNA)) - comprising 7% of their rent - continues to head downhill towards a likely bankruptcy.

The bear case is very strong at SNH as the company has a large debt burden and a shaky business model to dig itself out of. That being said, liquidity remains solid and if they can execute on their disposition program without selling assets at too steep of a discount, they should be able to stay in position to capitalize on upside from the silver wave over the next half decade.

While the agreement with Five Star equates to giving them a huge rent cut in the short term, it could lead to strong additional gains if/when the demographics shift to create a more favorable supply-demand dynamic for their properties. With 15 year plus leases on the Five Star properties, there is plenty of time for the demographic shift to play out in SNH's favor. Given the current share price and the more secure dividend, SNH should still be able to generate strong five-year returns for patient investors.

BPY owns a well-diversified portfolio of world-class properties, with the financial, operational, and network advantages that come from being associated with the large and growing Brookfield empire, giving it plenty of options to continue growing and improving its portfolio. Despite these competitive advantages, units remain cheap due to competing investment alternatives and concerns about over-exposure to U.S. retail real estate and over-leveraging as interest rates rise.

However, given the high quality of the properties and the low-risk structuring of much of its leverage, BPY remains a fairly safe investment with very strong total return potential. Finally, its 6.7% distribution combined with its mid-to-high single digit annual growth potential makes it one of the most attractive high yield and income growth combinations available today.

SKT is also not without risks as it is stuck in the crossfire between competition from traditional malls reinventing themselves and rapidly growing e-commerce. While it has a strong track record and plenty of liquidity with which to reinvest in its business, the long-term viability of outlets remains uncertain. That being said, its valuation presents an enormous margin of safety and the dividend alone (which appears quite safe at the moment and should continue to grow over the next several years) can provide solid total returns while waiting for the company to turn around its business performance.

REITs as a whole should provide strong relative performance in the emerging macroeconomic environment and these three add the bonus component of trading at deep discounts to net asset value with bull cases that offer the potential for high-teens annual total returns over the next half decade. That being said, none of them are cheap without reason and investors should carefully weigh the risks of each before investing.

223,BUSINESS,"Since President Trump escalated the trade war tension between the US and China on May 5th, Brent crude futures have in fact risen over 4.5% amid the rising geopolitical tensions in the middle east (full story). While trade war tensions have seen dips in oil prices, this has failed to keep a lid on higher oil prices as the rising geopolitical premium has been the key driver in the oil market. Alongside this, the backwardation in the 6-month Brent crude futures has surged to the highest level in over 4years at $3.31 (above 2018 peak of $3), consequently, implying that oil inventories could see a large drawdown later in the year. However, despite the surge in backwardation which is typically seen as a bullish sign as it hints at undersupply, this has not been associated with a notable lift in the spot price, which still has some way to go until the 2018 peak. As such, in order to remove this discrepancy oil prices could rise, or backwardation will have to ease.

Across the globe oil supply has been tightened in recent months, most notably from both Iran and Venezuela following the sanctions imposed by the US, while the latter has also seen oil supply further crippled by power outages. Elsewhere, tensions in the middle east have taking a turn for the worse after Iran backed Houthi Militias carried out a series of drone attacks at Saudi Aramco oil pipelines (full story), which in turn has raised concerns over the ease of transporting oil through the Strait of Hormuz (world’s major oil chokepoint).

Libyan oil production could also become an issue in the coming weeks as fighting within the country raises the risk of supply disruptions. Although, while supply has managed to increase in recent week, questions will remain as to whether the country can avoid production outages.

This weekend will see OPEC ministers (not including Iran) will meet in Saudi Arabia, in which they are expected to discuss the concerns surrounding oil supply, particularly in light of recent attacks. Focus will be on whether ministers signal that they are prepared to raise production in order to make up for the shortfall in Iranian and Venezuelan production. As a reminder, according to Thomson Reuters data, Saudi Arabia compliance rate is at 243%, meaning that they would have enough spare capacity in order to make up some of the shortfall.

Elsewhere, concerns of undersupply could be eased by the impact of rising trade war tensions, which in turn would likely weigh on growth, thus putting pressure on demand for oil, particularly across the emerging market complex.

Net Oil Importers: These countries tend to be worse off when the price of oil rises. This includes, KRW, ZAR, INR, TRY, EUR, CNY, IDR, JPY

224,BUSINESS,"Partying at Uber's headquarters in San Francisco started at 5:30 a.m. on May 10, the day the company launched its initial public offering (IPO), The Washington Post's Faiz Siddiqui reported.

San Francisco employees reportedly started drinking in the office during the morning and continued throughout the afternoon, spraying champagne and consuming liquor that had been stored in their desks since Travis Kalanick, one of the company's co-founders, was CEO. (Kalanick was replaced by Dara Khosrowshahi in 2017.)

The festivities in San Francisco led one employee to resign after what The Post described as ""a verbal outburst and dispute with colleagues"" and forced the company to stop another employee from driving home, according to The Post. A party at a satellite office in California was reportedly shut down.

Uber did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

The Post's report of Uber's IPO-day celebrations recalls the boisterous and aggressive culture during Kalanick's tenure described by employees who said the company had created a hostile, overly-competitive environment that was particularly harmful toward women.

Concerns about Uber's workplace culture contributed to Kalanick's departure and the hiring of Khosrowshahi, who has emphasized cultural change during his tenure. He outlined this goal in a 2017 LinkedIn post, in which he wrote, ""We do the right thing. Period.""

Before Khosrowshahi took over, Uber hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the company's culture, and in a 13-page report, Holder's recommendations included banning alcohol consumption during work hours and ""de-emphasizing alcohol as a component of work events."" Uber's board of directors agreed to implement all of Holder's recommendations.

Uber's share price fell 6.7% on its first day of trading, though it recovered to a level near its starting price of $42 when markets opened on Friday.

225,BUSINESS,"In a preliminary report on the March 1 crash, the NTSB said that initial data and video from the Tesla show that the driver turned on Autopilot about 10 seconds before the crash on a divided highway with turn lanes in the median. From less than eight seconds until the time of the crash, the driver's hands were not detected on the steering wheel, the NTSB report stated.

Neither the data nor the videos indicated the driver or the Autopilot system braked or tried to avoid the trailer, the report stated.

The Model 3 was going 68 miles per hour when it hit the trailer on U.S. 441, and the speed limit was 55 mph, the report said. Jeremy Beren Banner, 50, was killed.

Tesla said in a statement Thursday that Banner did not use Autopilot at any other time during the drive before the crash. Vehicle logs show that he took his hands off the steering wheel immediately after activating Autopilot, the statement said.

Tesla also said it's saddened by the crash and that drivers have traveled more than 1 billion miles while using Autopilot.

""When used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by Autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance,"" the company said.

The circumstances of the Delray Beach crash are much like one that occurred in May 2016 near Gainesville, Florida. Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was traveling in a Tesla Model S on a divided highway and using the Autopilot system when he was killed.

Neither Brown nor the car braked for a tractor-trailer, which had turned left in front of the Tesla and was crossing its path. Brown's Tesla also went beneath the trailer and its roof was sheared off. After that crash Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company made changes in its system so radar would play more of a role in detecting objects.

David Friedman, who was acting head of NHTSA in 2014 and is now vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports, said he was surprised the agency didn't declare Autopilot defective after the Gainesville crash and seek a recall. The Delray Beach crash, he said, reinforces that Autopilot is being allowed to operate in situations it cannot handle safely.

""Their system cannot literally see the broad side of an 18-wheeler on the highway,"" Friedman said.

Tesla's system was too slow to warn the driver to pay attention, unlike systems that Consumer Reports has tested from General Motors and other companies, Friedman said. GM's Super Cruise driver assist system only operates on divided highways with no median turn lanes, he said.

Tesla needs a better system to more quickly detect whether drivers are paying attention and warn them if they are not, Friedman said, adding that some owners tend to rely on the system too much.

""Tesla has for too long been using human drivers as guinea pigs. This is tragically what happens,"" he said.

To force a recall, NHTSA must do an investigation and show that the way a vehicle is designed is outside of industry standards. ""There are multiple systems out on the roads right now that take over some level of steering and speed control, but there's only one of them that we keep hearing about where people are dying or getting into crashes. That kind of stands out,"" Friedman said.

NHTSA said Thursday that its investigation is continuing and its findings will be made public when it's completed.

The Delray Beach crash casts doubt on Musk's statement that Tesla will have fully self-driving vehicles on the roads sometime next year. Musk said last month that Tesla had developed a powerful computer that could use artificial intelligence to safely navigate the roads with the same camera and radar sensors that are now on Tesla cars.

""Show me the data,"" Friedman said. ""Tesla is long on big claims and short on proof. They're literally showing how not to do it by rushing technology out.""

In a 2017 report on the Gainesville crash, the NTSB wrote that design limitations of Autopilot played a major role. The agency said that Tesla told Model S owners that Autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, primarily interstates. The report said that despite upgrades to the system, Tesla did not incorporate protections against use of the system on other types of roads.

The NTSB found that the Model S cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. Rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles they are following to prevent rear-end collisions.","Tesla Model 3 Was Using Autopilot Before Fatally Crashing Into a Semi, NTSB Says"

* Under Armour gains after JPM upgrades to ""overweight""

May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Friday, after three straight sessions of gains, as trade tensions were renewed after Chinese media took a hardline approach to the tariff dispute between the United States and China.

The trade war will only make China stronger and will never bring the country to its knees, the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily wrote in a front-page commentary.

Beijing's higher tariffs on U.S. products on a $60 billion target list will take effect on June 1, which could prompt Washington to go ahead with tariffs on a further $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.

The two sides are expected to meet in China to resume talks soon.

""Mounting trade worries and geopolitical tensions are weighing on investors nerves,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

""The trade war tensions are overcoming the positive in markets so investors are skeptical and markets are caught in a trading range.""

The escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies led farm equipment maker Deere & Co to cut its full-year forecast, sending its shares down 4.3%.

The drop in shares of Deere, as well as Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co pressured the tariff-sensitive industrial sector, which was trading 0.7% lower.

Technology companies including iPhone maker Apple Inc and chipmakers, which rely on China for a large portion of their revenue, were also hit by trade fears.

Apple Inc fell nearly 1.2% also weighed down by Nomura Instinet's price target cut on its stock, citing headwinds from the tariff war.

The Philadelphia chip index slipped 0.2%, while the broader technology sector fell 0.4%, weighing the most on the S&P 500.

All three major indexes have posted gains three days in a row this week as upbeat quarterly results and a batch of strong economic data helped ease worries of a global economic slowdown.

The S&P 500 index is now about 3% away from its record high hit earlier this month.

At 9:42 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 90.51 points, or 0.35%, at 25,772.17, the S&P 500 was down 11.56 points, or 0.40%, at 2,864.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 36.74 points, or 0.47%, at 7,861.31.

Among stocks, Applied Materials Inc gained 4.9%, the most among S&P companies, after the chip gear maker's upbeat third-quarter profit eased concerns about waning chip demand.

228,BUSINESS,"Consumer sentiment rocketed to its highest level in 15 years in early May as Americans grew more upbeat on the health of the economy and its path in 2019, according to data released Friday.

The University of Michigan's preliminary print on its consumer sentiment index rose to 102.4, up from 97.2 in April and well ahead of economist expectations of 97.5.

""Consumers viewed prospects for the overall economy much more favorably, with the economic outlook for the near and longer term reaching their highest levels since 2004,"" said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers. ""To be sure, negative references to tariffs rose in the past week and are likely to rise further in late May and June.""

The optimistic consumer outlook was mostly recorded before U.S.-China trade deliberations soured earlier this month.

Last week, the Trump administration raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to Beijing's attempts to renegotiate a trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. China then responded in kind, bumping taxes on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods in retaliation.

Aggravated trade tensions between the U.S. and China could dampen consumer sentiment going forward, Curtin said, and will likely weigh on subsequent reports in May and June.

""Even apart from the direct impact of tariffs on prices, rising tariffs could cause a more general loss of confidence which could further diminish the pace of consumer spending,"" Curtin wrote. ""At present, the data point toward moderate spending growth in the year ahead.

At a time when the national unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly half a century, three states have set all-time records.

Vermont's lowest-in-the-nation 2.2% jobless rate represents a new historic mark for the Green Mountain state, according to a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Along with the new low for Vermont, Pennsylvania at 3.8% and Wisconsin's 2.8% set new standards for state unemployment as indicated by records that go back to 1976. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin's fortunes are significant in that they will be key swing states in the 2020 election, during which the economy's performance under President Donald Trump will be a critical issue.

The trends come the same month that the U.S. rate fell to 3.6%, its lowest reading since December 1969.

That national decline came amid a fall in the labor force participation rate, which pushes the headline number lower. However, a more encompassing gauge that also includes discouraged workers, the underemployed and those considered marginally attached to the labor force also held at 7.3%, an 18-year low.

Alaska has the highest rate in the country at 6.5%.

For the full year, 29 states have seen job gains while the rest have been essentially unchanged. The states with the largest growth over the past 12 months were Texas (294,200), California (271,600) and Florida (206,100.)

Over the past year, the biggest drop in the jobless rate came in Delaware, which fell 0.7 percentage points to 3.2%.

The chip unit’s CEO — He Tingbo — said Huawei foresaw years ago that the U.S. government might “suppress” the company and cut channels for it to acquire chip-related technology from the U.S.

And indeed, this fear has become a reality.

The U.S. Department of Commerce said Wednesday it was putting Huawei on a blacklist that could ban it from doing business with its American suppliers. The company responded that it will pursue “remedies immediately and find a resolution” if its business is banned in the United States.

The move may especially disrupt Huawei’s chip production, which depends heavily on American components. Therefore, the chip unit, called HiSilicon, has developed “alternative chips” for just such a scenario — though it did not expect the situation to actually happen, the letter reveals.

As the U.S. made the “insane” decision to put Huawei on the blacklist “with no evidence,” and “history has made the choice” to put all reserved alternative chips into formal use “in one night,” the letter said.

Meanwhile, Huawei's smartphone business is plowing forward. It unveiled its 5G smartphone Mate 20 X in London on Thursday, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. The Mate 20 X uses the Balong 5000 chip, which was released in January before Huawei's shift toward using ""alternative chips.""",Huawei Prepares ‘Alternative Chips’ to Cope With U.S. Ban - Caixin Global

234,BUSINESS,"“We can now catch this sort of thing — proactively,” Mr. Schroepfer said.

The problem was that the marijuana-versus-broccoli exercise was not just a sign of progress, but also of the limits that Facebook was hitting. Mr. Schroepfer’s team has built A.I systems that the company now uses to identify and remove pot images, nudity and terrorist-related content. But the systems are not catching all of those pictures, as there is always unexpected content, which means millions of nude, marijuana-related and terrorist-related posts continue reaching the eyes of Facebook users.

Identifying rogue images is also one of the easier tasks for A.I. It is harder to build systems to identify false news stories or hate speech. False news stories can easily be fashioned to appear real. And hate speech is problematic because it is so difficult for machines to recognize linguistic nuances. Many nuances differ from language to language, while context around conversations rapidly evolves as they occur, making it difficult for the machines to keep up.

Delip Rao, head of research at A.I. Foundation, a nonprofit that explores how artificial intelligence can fight disinformation, described the challenge as “an arms race.” A.I. is built from what has come before. But so often, there is nothing to learn from. Behavior changes. Attackers create new techniques. By definition, it becomes a game of cat and mouse.

“Sometimes you are ahead of the people causing harm,” Mr. Rao said. “Sometimes they are ahead of you.”

On that afternoon, Mr. Schroepfer tried to answer our questions about the cat-and-mouse game with data and numbers. He said Facebook now automatically removed 96 percent of all nudity from the social network. Hate speech was tougher, he said — the company catches 51 percent of that on the site. (Facebook later said this had risen to 65 percent.)

Mr. Schroepfer acknowledged the arms race element. Facebook, which can automatically detect and remove problematic live video streams, did not identify the New Zealand video in March, he said, because it did not really resemble anything uploaded to the social network in the past. The video gave a first-person viewpoint, like a computer game.

In designing systems that identify graphic violence, Facebook typically works backward from existing images — images of people kicking cats, dogs attacking people, cars hitting pedestrians, one person swinging a baseball bat at another. But, he said, “none of those look a lot like this video.”",Facebook’s A.I. Whiz Now Faces the Task of Cleaning It Up. Sometimes That Brings Him to Tears.
235,BUSINESS,"Deere & Co.[ticker symb=DE] reported second-quarter earnings early Friday that missed Wall Street expectations and cut full-year guidance. The farm equipment giant, which thrives when American farmers havest big profits, highlighted uncertainty from an escalation of the China trade war, including new retaliatory tariffs by China. Deere stock fell before the stock market open.

""Ongoing concerns about export market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and a delayed planting season in

 much of North America are causing farmers to become much more cautious about making major purchases,"" Deere CEO Samuel Allen said.

Estimates: Analysts expected Deere earnings per share to grow 14% to $3.57 in the first quarter. Revenue was expected to rise 4.1% to $10.15 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.

Outlook: Deere lowered 2019 sales growth guidance from 7% to 5%, including a 3% currency adjustment. Management pared net income guidance from $3.6 billion to $3.3 billion.

Shares fell 4.5% to 139.40 in early stock market trading. Deere stock rose to within a few percent of its February 2018 all-time high last month, before entering a tailspin. Shares have lost more than 15% as expectations of a quick China trade deal were dashed. Deere stock has tumbled through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The relative strength line already was at a six-month low, signaling Deere stock's underperformance for the S&P 500 index.

A week ago, President Trump escalated the China trade war by hiking tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%. On Monday, Beijing responded by raising tariffs as high as 25% on $60 billion of exports from the U.S. Peanuts, sugar, wheat, chicken and turkey were among the targets. Soybean exports to China were hit by an earlier round of 25% tariffs.

But tariffs aren't the only worry for U.S. farmers. JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan this week downgraded Deere to underweight. She cited ""rapidly deteriorating"" fundamentals and ""a perfect storm"" of problems for U.S. farmers.

Beyond the tariffs, she noted that an African swine fever outbreak will cut China's demand for soybeans to feed hogs. Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina have near-record corn and soybean crops. A strong dollar is yet another challenge.

236,BUSINESS,"Riot Games has announced that it will not be eliminating the arbitration clause for current employees that moved some 200-250 employees to stage a walkout last Monday.

Now, nearly two weeks after the demonstration, Riot Games announced in a blog post that ""given the complexities of ongoing litigation, we will not change our employee agreements while in active litigation.""

""We know not everyone agrees with this decision, but we also know everyone does want Riot to continue to improve. We remain committed to having a firm answer around extending an opt-out to all Rioters when active litigation concludes,"" it read.

In a statement to IGN, the walkout's organizers say the policy is ""unlikely to change anytime soon. We’re disappointed leadership doesn’t seem to be considering any major changes to their active policy."" They go on to say that while they will continue organizing in the coming weeks, ""our main goal is to make sure that workers at Riot feel heard and represented, and above all, safe.""

That's not all to say that last Monday's walkout had no effect, however. The post from Riot said that in the wake of continued discussions with employees, it has ""invited a diverse group of Rioters to participate in reviewing aspects of our Code of Conduct where they have concerns,"" and formed a new employee committee to ""create change and identify barriers and opportunities to move us forward in D&I and culture.""

Speaking with IGN, one of the demonstration's organizers, Jocelyn Monahan, said, ""I am looking forward to the review of the Code of Conduct, because it seriously needs to be updated to reflect current Rioters’ concerns for their safety."" She declined an invitation to join the D&I council, ""Because after the contents of the Unplugged yesterday I do not feel confident that my voice would be respected,"" though wasn't at liberty to discuss the specifics of the town-hall-style meeting.

237,BUSINESS,"China's currency has been an important barometer for progress in U.S.-Chinese trade talks, and right now it's signaling that things aren't going well.

The question is whether that signal is intentional, and whether Chinese officials will step in to prevent the yuan from reaching a key psychological low of 7 to the dollar. That level has become a line in the sand for markets around the world, and if broken, it could trigger a negative reaction in risk markets globally, as investors move to price in a bigger economic impact from a longer, more contentious trade war.

The yuan has been fairly stable this year, as the U.S. and China carried on trade talks. But since President Donald Trump tweeted about new tariffs May 5, the onshore yuan or CNY, has lost 2.7% against the U.S. dollar.

""Obviously, the trade shock we're now discussing is a full blown trade war, so it's obviously a very serious scenario. Then we have this negotiations period, where it could be averted and that doesn't seem to be very good at all,"" said Jens Nordvig, CEO of Exante Data. ""It's also unclear whether the Chinese officials want to fight hard to keep the currency stable. That's a question mark that came in today.""

The onshore currency, or CNH, which trades in Hong Kong and is more impacted by international traders, hit a high of 6.945, while the onshore yuan, more controlled by the central bank, was just above 6.91 Friday. Nordvig said unlike other sessions, there was no sign Friday that the People's Bank of China tried to stem the decline.

Also unclear was whether it was an intentional action, and Chinese officials were responding to trade tensions and the U.S. action this week blocking telecom firm Huawei from buying U.S. components.

A weaker yuan has been a source of friction between China and the U.S. for years. Trump, in the past, had accused China of intentionally weakening its currency, hurting the U.S. as a result. If China does allow its currency to weaken, its exports would become more attractive, but strategists say Beijing would then worry about capital flight and it would probably not want to risk that.

""The market is testing the central bank's resolve to defend the 7 lever,"" said Marc Chandler, global market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""They'll do in a couple of ways, partly through intervention, partly through draining liquidity, raising the cost of being short the Chinese currency. They can do this in the domestic money market and in the domestic Hong Kong market.""

Nordvig said the message the yuan is sending is not like the positive comments about the trade talks that U.S. officials like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin or White House top economist Larry Kudlow have made.

""It looks like they're not even being invited to China. If there's no talks ahead of Trump and [President Xi Jinping] meeting in Osaka, then the meeting becomes binary and very risky,"" said Nordvig. Trump and Xi are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting June 28.

""It would be very different if Mnuchin makes some progress on some chapters here in the next couple of weeks. If that doesn't happen we come close to the cliff,"" said Nordvig, adding the question is whether Chinese officials are going to hold the currency up.""

Strategists say the yuan current weakness is due to a strengthening dollar and trade war concerns, which in turn are prodding Chinese authorities to consider more monetary and fiscal policy moves.

""It's selling off on expectations of easier monetary policy and apparently no trade talks. China says we haven't invited the U.S. back,"" said Chandler, adding he expects the currency to challenge the 7 level soon.

""I think we'll test it. We'll test Chinese resolve. It will become more of a concern that it will be an inflection point if the CNY or CNH get to 7. It will have a ripple effect on the markets. It will be another source of instability. Another rubicon has been crossed,"" he said.

Adam Cole, head of G-10 foreign exchange strategy at RBC, said reports that unnamed Chinese officials said the PBOC would not let the currency trade through 7 suggests that such a move won't happen soon. But he said the yuan could breach those levels in the future.

""Longer term, with the dollar generally going up against everything, I think that constraint becomes nonbinding,"" Cole said. He said the dollar's rise has to do with monetary policy positioning, cyclicality and the fact that the U.S. economy looks stronger than the rest of the world.

China has been reducing its holdings of Treasurys, which some say could be a warning to the U.S. But Cole said he does not believe China, the largest holder of Treasurys, would bail out of the market in a big way.

""That's an ongoing concern. Like most people,we think the risk of China going through a sudden liquidation and allocation out of Treasurys is unlikely. That would be a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face, given how much China has to lose,"" he said.",China's currency is sending a warning signal about the trade war

239,BUSINESS,"The Hamptons, once the favored vacation destination of New York City's wealthy elite, is seeing home prices plummet and high-end properties sitting on the market for months, The New York Times reported.

The median sale price of a Hamptons home has fallen 7.9% to $860,000, according to a report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. That puts Hamptons home sales at their lowest levels in seven years, as Business Insider's Gina Heeb previously reported.

This luxury real-estate slump can be traced, in part, to Donald Trump's 2016 federal tax reform, as the Financial Times' Ben Foldy reported. The new tax laws make it more expensive for homeowners to own luxury homes because they can deduct only $10,000 in state and local taxes from their federal income taxes.

""The high-end of the Hamptons housing market continued to move slower [in the first quarter of 2019] in the aftermath of the new federal tax law,"" the Douglas Elliman report reads.

The most expensive homes for sale in the Hamptons are suffering the most, Laura Brady, president and founder of Concierge Auctions in Manhattan, told The Times. The priciest homes sold in the Hamptons in 2018 sat on the market for an average of 706.7 days before finally selling, according to a report from Brady's company.

Part of the problem is that the wealthiest buyers — those looking at homes priced at $10 million or above — have already owned homes in the Hamptons for years, according to Zachary Vichinsky of Bespoke Real Estate.

And other luxury buyers who might've previously bought in the Hamptons are instead looking north to places like New York's Hudson Valley and the Catskills, where prices are more affordable and buyers value the proximity to Manhattan, outdoor activities, and stunning landscapes, as Business Insider's Madeline Stone reported in 2017.

""The lower Hudson Valley is certainly easier to get to than the Hamptons,"" Richard Ellis, owner of Ellis Sotheby's International Realty in Nyack, New York, told Business Insider at the time. ""People who buy on our side of the river are not 'keeping up [with] the Joneses,' so to speak.

241,BUSINESS,"In this article, we'll take a look at a stock on my permanent watch list - 3M Company (MMM). Because of recent stock price developments, the share price is tanking and certain groups of investors are sprinting for the hills. The stock has suffered rating downgrades, and this begs the question for many investors if the company remains investable long-term to the degree it has before.

In this article, I share my view on the situation, I go through some of the risks with the stock, and show you why I believe that 3M remains one of the best stocks out there that you can buy long-term, as well what sort of expectations you need to have short-term if you decide to invest.

3M stands for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The company, founded in 1902, has over 60,000 products in its roster, covering needs in five different business segments. This company is active in everything from applied nanotechnology to ceramics and simple Post-its, and for the past decades, it's been thriving.

The company is currently split into the following business areas.

For a company as large as 3M however, let's break down these further to illustrate the scope of company operations.
• Industrial handles sealants, adhesives, ceramics, tapes and abrasives for a variety of applications.
• Consumer Products is by far the smallest of the segments with the eponymous Post-it notes, tapes, sponges, home improvement products and consumer adhesives.

In terms of size, Industrial and Healthcare are largest in terms of sales with about a quarter of company income each, but the segments are otherwise diversified enough where no clear segment (apart from Consumer Products) is clearly the smallest.

Unlike many American companies I try to cover on Seeking Alpha, 3M is also exceedingly diversified into other geographies, with only ~40% of sales going to the US.

While its dividend growth record stretches 60+ years, the company has actually paid an uninterrupted dividend for over 100 years. Chances are it will continue paying a dividend for another 100 years, long after everyone who reads this is gone.

3M has a long history of creating value and profits for the company and company shareholders. Not only that, but also the company operates with sector-beating margins in excess of 20%+, translating into some excellent competitive advantages across the board.

The company's products often have the characteristic of being very simple in substance (adhesives, Post-its, abrasives and so forth), but at the same time being mission-critical to the customer's project application.

For instance, despite the paperless office revolution, Post-its are still a core part of most offices worldwide (including mine own!). Take something more serious, such as an automotive adhesive, or the Thinsulate Thermal insulation, for example.

The products the company produces provide such a pricing power to manufacturers/customers that it isn't, from a customer perspective, not worth risking end-product reliability for a few cents in savings. The adhesives the company makes, after all, bind materials such as plastics, metals, and ceramics, and are mission-critical to the end product.

3M produces consumables, as we know. What this means is that constant repurchasing is a necessity, adding another dimension to the company's advantage. It allows the company to continually increase its prices year by year while retaining strong customer loyalty more or less across the board.

Many of the larger industrial conglomerates have had to adapt to the current changing world - 3M is no exception. Industrial conditions are no longer the same as they were 20-30 years ago.

3M has reduced the number of operating divisions from 40 to 23 and sold 10 underperforming units entirely. The sale was cheap - $2.1B in total, but the important thing for 3M was to get the units off the books. Included in the sales were electronic monitoring, toll/license plate converting, safety glasses (prescription-based), noise monitoring, cathode batteries, and identity management. The margin for these units was below 5%. For some companies, this may have been enough, but not for 3M.

The new company CEO has embraced Lean Six Sigma and actively manages divisions based mostly on profitability and growth. 3M has shown that regardless of division tradition within the company, it'll cut underperforming areas off quick enough if no improvement is shown.

Unlike other companies that embrace their legacy businesses, 3M has no such illusions, if legacy doesn't equate profit.

Few companies run as well as 3M. The company has the following capital allocation plan going forward.

FY18 results were acceptable in the big picture.

The company is targeting an EPS/FCF growth rate of 9.5% yearly for investors, meaning the dividend should grow at a similar pace as well. Current key financials look appealing for a company the size of 3M.

While the company's earnings have lagged for two years, the overall trend is very encouraging, with ever-increasing levels of earnings growth and cash flow generation. Sales have grown from $23.1B annually to $32.4B in 10 years, marking a ~40% increase in sales.

3M's profitability indicators are ridiculously good, operating at almost twice the preferred margins of metrics given by dividend investment sites. Return on invested capital/RoE shows just how effective this company is at generating large amounts of money.

Overall, here we see some of the reasons why 3M is attributed a premium valuation - and why I, who usually am more conservative with such premiums, am willing to accept a certain degree of market premium in this stock.

Key indicators for the full year of 2018 were up. The company locked in overall organic growth and improved EPS by 12% for the year, with a RoIC of 22%, far above industrial averages. The premium margins, as we can see above, were still very much in effect at 25% margins (Source: Annual Report 2018).

A significant M&A was also done, in line with the company's focus on the portfolio. The company has acquired M*Modal's tech business, providing AI-powered healthcare solutions for the market.

One thing to note here in terms of 3M's M&As. As opposed to other large companies, 3M has a historical tendency of choosing smaller deals as opposed to market-changing mergers typical to some companies. 3M rarely does M&As to change sales as a result of the M&A directly, but rather improve existing products and businesses.

This approach and the results of it can be seen in the firm's impressive historical and current RoIC. It's hard to argue with numbers like that.

Company debt is also very much under control. The company comes in at a 1.68X net debt/EBITDA ratio, giving it plenty of room to leverage its balance sheet, should the situation warrant it. The company has not, at least not for the last 10 years, ever had more of a ratio than 1.89X however.

3M has a history of using debt and leverage extremely conservatively. Despite the company's plans to increase share repurchases and invest in growth projects, the current leverage will guarantee that even with these projects realized, 3M will continue to hold a sector-beating balance sheet in terms of safety.

The S&P AA-credit rating is rare to find in companies of this size and sector, and given that management guidance provides a target of sub-2.0 leverage, there is very little risk that anything should materially change in this respect.

That isn't to say that 3M as a business isn't exposed to its fair share of risks. Let's do the rundown here.

First, macro. 3M is an industrial. While it's one of the highest-quality industrials on the market, it's still exposed to the characteristic cyclical patterns of any industrial in the sector over short periods of time.

Macro risks such as trade wars, price volatility, raw material costs, macro slowdowns, and FX effects influence 3M like any other company, and given its international profile, one could make a case for some serious FX and trade war risks here going forward.

The current pressure - Are things still golden in 3M?

Nothing of these macro risks can, however, compare to the current pressures we're seeing on the stock. As of yet, the new CEO has failed to deliver analyst expectations even a single time - and that's saying something for someone who's supposed to lead one of the world's largest industrials.

This says some things, and few of them are positive.

The company cut its guidance once more time during April 2019, and this was what started the decline of the share price we're seeing right now; shares are trading at ~$170/share.

So what's happening with the company numbers?
• The company missed EPS and revenue growth targets; instead reporting a 1.1% decline and 11% EPS drop on a YoY basis.
• The decline wasn't limited to any one segment, but was general. Sales declines affected 4/5 segments and margin declines in 3/5. That's not good for a company that touts its margins and recession resistance.
• It adjusted revenue growth targets to -1% to 2% for the year as opposed to a 2-4% growth, and adjusted EPS growth to absolute flat as opposed to 2018 (a slash of almost 12%).

So, the company is utterly failing to meet analyst expectations. And when a company which prides itself on this is suffering from this, you may indeed expect a market reaction.

And a reaction is something we've gotten. On a day the S&P is up by almost a full 100bps, this company keeps dropping.

So what is happening under the hood?
• Weaker industrial sales in the U.S. and China directly resulting from management insufficiencies to the ongoing economic slowdown.
• The company's recent M&A, the largest ever, of healthcare company Acelity, which potentially will increase the debt to over 2.0X, giving this conservative company one of the highest leverages it has ever had. Important to note, however, Moody's has said the company's rating will stay the same (Source: Moody's).
• The ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict will no doubt further complicate the company's efforts to meet guidance going forward. In a word, it won't.

So, to conclude the risk segment here, the cause for the share price drop is a number of justified misses, poor performance from management, guidance cuts, M&A worries, leverage worries, macro worries, and a potential long-term trade war escalation.

Put into context, the share price drop in relation to this doesn't seem all that crazy.

Of course, 3M's management isn't just sitting on its hands while things are beginning to unravel.

The above restructuring is already in the process of being realized. In addition, the company is looking at reducing segments from five to four, further streamlining 3M. Management hopes that through this restructuring plan, it will be able to able to meet the ambitions of its growth plan going forward over the next five years.

Now, regardless of how 3M goes forward here, the conglomerate has lost some of its previous magical touch. In addition, Mr. Market/the Street seems to have lost confidence in the new CEO despite his 30-year history with the company.

From a seven-year perspective, the company hasn't been valued at these levels for a long time. From a yield perspective, 3M hasn't had as high a yield as this since 1995. So far, we have some pretty good arguments for why this represents an appealing valuation, stock price premium notwithstanding.

As I said before, I do believe that the company warrants a premium valuation given its history and growth prospects, despite the somewhat tarnished reputation over the past few quarters. At this valuation, 3M will produce annual returns of just below 14% looking at the company premium.

While this may not seem much compared to other companies we've looked at, we need to take into consideration the scope of the company we're looking at here, and where it usually trades.

When we do this, the picture becomes at the very least a bit more appealing. And that's more or less where I will conclude the valuation portion for the stock.

Because today's share price doesn't exactly scream ""undervaluation"" in the traditional sense. However, I don't believe that a company like 3M, barring events like the financial crisis, will ever scream ""undervaluation"". Companies of this caliber warrant some moderation of expectation.

I believe an investment in 3M requires a degree of trust in the premium valuation here. The company could, of course, drop lower going forward. That doesn't change the fact that we're looking at some of the lowest 3M valuations for a long time.

3M bears will speak of poor managements' ability to run even great companies into the ground. They will speak of GE (NYSE:GE) in the US, and they will speak of European companies with similar histories where previously excellent companies have been ruined.

Former 3M CEO Inge Thulin faced similar challenges during his first years of tenure at 3M, battling weak results. This later turned around. It's never easy, and I believe it is far too early to say yay or nay to this CEO or his ability to generate results. In fact, his successful track history in 3M would suggest that his ability is second to very few.

The company has a 117-year history of adapting to changing market conditions. To believe it will flounder here would, to me, require more proof than a few quarters of missing analyst expectations.

Valuation at this time shows us undervaluation relative to historical norms. For a company of this character, that is reason enough to perk up and check it out.

In my view, this drop is a gift not to be squandered, as I've long hoped for the opportunity to buy this time-tested giant. As of this week, I have. In the long term, I'm positive on 3M due to all of these reasons, and I believe headwinds to be short-term and the company will be able to adapt to these market conditions.

However, as with all investment theses touching companies like this, I do believe you need to moderate short-term expectations. I don't believe a full turnaround will be quick, and I do believe patience is key when it comes to 3M going forward (2019-2022).

With a company like 3M, however, given the company record, that patience is easily exercised.

I don't share the bear view that this is the first sign that something is seriously wrong at 3M - I believe this to be a temporary stumble, which 3M, in time, will solve.

Thank you kindly for reading.

At these valuations, I consider 3M a definite ""BUY"". A share price of ~$170 and a blended P/E valuation of 17.2 are very rare for this company. The yield has not been this high for over 10 years. While investors should moderate their expectations short-term, I do believe 3M represents an appealing opportunity for the long-term DGI investor.

242,BUSINESS,"The trade war between the U.S. and China is escalating with no end in sight, increasing the likelihood that the stock market will be gripped by high volatility and sharp plunges for the foreseeable future, according to several investors and market watchers. In recent months, many of the major moves in the market have correlated with new developments in the trade conflict, or shifting expectations about its future course and the likelihood of a timely resolution.

“It is possible we will still see trade volatility and trade tensions all the way up until the election, because it is a strong political position,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told The Wall Street Journal. In a bearish sign for technical analysts, both the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped below their 50-day moving averages earlier this week. However, both indexes have remained above their 200-day averages, and the S&P moved just above its 50-day average by early afternoon Thursday, as detailed in the chart below.

A positive technical sign is that, in addition to the S&P 500 as a whole being above its 200-day moving average, so are 58% of the stocks that constitute it, per analysis by Dow Jones Market Data cited by the Journal. While this is above the 39% figure at the end of 2018, it nonetheless is sharply below the recent high of 73% reached in April.

As recent evidence of how the trade situation is roiling the markets, on Monday stocks plummeted after China announced tariffs on about $60 billion of imports from U.S., then rallied for several days after President Trump indicated that a trade deal will be forged ""when the time is right,"" as quoted by the Journal. Some investors anticipate that Trump is far from done with actions on tariffs, trade, and protectionism, meaning that these will remain big political issues, and thus big movers of stock prices, from now through the 2020 elections.

Adding to the uncertainties about trade, there is the possibility that the tariffs imposed by Trump, such as those on all imported steel and on various imports from China, are likely to be a permanent protectionist move, and not just bargaining chips in trade negotiations, according to a detailed analysis in The New York Times. The U.S. now has a trade-weighted average tariff rate of 4.2%, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, per the Times. This is higher than each of the other six other G-7 industrialized nations, more than double the figures for five of the six, and even higher than most emerging markets countries, including China and Russia.

This week, investors will be anxious to see if Trump makes good on prior threats to impose global auto tariffs, which could shatter the brief rally in stocks. This move has drawn criticism from auto makers and policy analysts alike, and also would sharply raise car prices for consumers.

Upheaval stemming from trade wars may look benign if the forecast of a prominent longterm bear is correct. Albert Edwards, the co-head of global strategy at investment banking firm Societe Generale, says the markets are heading toward a financial and economic ""Ice Age."" Under that scenario, an onslaught of severe deflation will send U.S. and European bond yields and stock prices crashing. Edwards says the experience of Japan after its credit bubble burst in the late 1980s is the template for his dire scenario.","Stocks Seen Facing Sharp Drops, Endless Upheaval Amid Trade Politics"

244,BUSINESS,"HONG KONG -- China's top search engine Baidu has unveiled its first loss in 14 years, amid regulatory headwinds, a softer Chinese economy and the departure of top talent.

Known as the ""Google of China,"" Nasdaq-listed Baidu lost 327 million yuan ($49 million) in the January-March quarter, according to its filing on Thursday night U.S. time. It is the company's first net loss since listing in 2005.

The weak showing risks knocking Baidu out of the so-called Big Three tech companies of China, alongside e-commerce platform Alibaba Group Holding and social media leader Tencent Holdings. Though often grouped together as the ""BAT"" companies, Baidu is increasingly lagged behind the two companies in financial performance.

""When we talk about BAT, B no longer stands for Baidu; it refers to ByteDance,"" said a venture capitalist who focuses on Chinese tech companies. ByteDance is the operator of hugely popular short video app TikTok and the company last year surpassed Silicon Valley ride-sharing heavyweight Uber in valuation according to research company CB Insights.

On Wednesday, New York-listed Alibaba said net income rose more than 250% on the year to reach 23.4 billion yuan during the January-March quarter, and Hong Kong-listed Tencent's net income jumped 17% to 27.2 billion yuan.

While the rivals cultivate new areas of revenue, such as electronic payment, cloud services and online games, Baidu still relies heavily on its search engine. Baidu enjoyed a more than 90% share of that sector when Google shut down its Chinese search engine in 2010, but that share has dropped to roughly 70%, as domestic rivals have grown market share.

Baidu's quarterly sales grew 15% on the year to 24.1 billion yuan, lower than the projected 29.3 billion yuan by Refinitiv.

The weaker performance was accompanied by news that veteran executive, Xiang Hailong, senior vice president of the search business, would quit the company for 'personal reasons' after 14 years with Baidu.

Analysts are waiting to see how Baidu will deal with the setback of Xiang's exit. Xiang is the latest among a growing number of top executives to leave the company. Last year, Lu Qi, the captain of Baidu's artificial intelligence unit, left the company for ""personal reasons,"" raising doubts about how Baidu will transform from a search engine to a cutting edge AI company. Lin Yuanqing, former head of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning, also resigned in 2017.

Baidu has faced controversy in China over whether it has abused its monopoly on internet search by prioritizing paid for results. Sales from search-focused online marketing accounted for 73% of Baidu's total revenues in the quarter.

But the performance of that division has been suffering. ""Despite government policies to improve the market condition for SMEs, we anticipate online marketing in the near term to face a challenging environment,"" Herman Yu, Baidu's finance chief, said in a statement.

As a result, Baidu said its second-quarter revenue forecast would range from 25.1 billion yuan to 26.6 billion yuan, posing a 2% decrease compared to a year ago on the lower end.

Beijing's tougher scrutiny of health care, gaming, and financial services had thrown a chilling effect on its online ad sales, Yu said. In addition, China's economic slowdown has taken a toll on many industries, which has dealt another blow to Baidu's advertising business, he added.

Shares of Baidu were down nearly 10% in the aftermarket trading on Thursday. The net worth of Robin Li, the company's founder and CEO, shrunk to $14.6 billion in 2018 from $17.1 billion a year before, according to Forbes' China Richest List published in October.

""Baidu's trouble will likely last for a long time,"" said Ming Lu, a Shanghai-based analyst with financial network SmartKarma. Many of Baidu's new initiatives remain loss-making, Lu said, while its major revenue driver has lost steam amid the economic downturn and fiercer competition with Chinese social media and entertainment giant Tencent Holdings.

Since its online gaming business was hit by regulatory headwinds last year, Tencent has stepped up efforts to cash in on its advertising business.

Baidi said it is seeking new growth opportunities from China's ""Smart City"" development, a government-led project that aims to digitalize and smarten up the operation of Chinese cities with cloud and AI technology -- a sector that Alibaba and Tencent have already invested heavily.

245,BUSINESS,"One of New York City’s most iconic buildings is open again. As promised during years of teasing and hype, the TWA Hotel is officially welcoming guests into its handsome, mid-century doors. But does that mean that you — presumably a busy New Yorker who doesn’t love the idea of sitting on the A train for an hour-plus out to Queens — should actually check it out? Read on to see what we think.

Seriously, what’s the deal with this place?

After 18 years languishing in plain sight, John F. Kennedy International Airport’s iconic TWA Flight Center — the retro-spacey building sitting just outside the airport’s Terminal 5 that was designed by Eero Saarinen and originally completed in 1962 — reopens this week as the TWA Hotel, one of the most bonkers, meticulous restoration projects in recent memory.

Now, the developer, MCR — which is said to have outbid Ian Schrager and Donald Trump for the contract — has reopened the building, flanked by two new wings, as a 512-room hotel. And, as with any big-money real-estate project, there are bars and restaurants designed to entice people to visit.

Are you really telling me to go to the airport to eat dinner?

Not exactly. Architecture fans will want to check out the restored terminal building, which certainly looks like it was brought back to life with a painstaking eye for period details. (The team also bought many pieces — including Mies van der Rohe armchairs — from the 2016 Four Seasons auction.) As Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR said earlier this week, “We’ve restored everything to exactly as it was in 1962.” Here’s an example: Through one arched side door is an unassuming round banquette designed by Charles Eames. It used to be called the “Pope’s chair,” because Paul VI and John Paul II, both TWA fans, would receive their final guests here while waiting to depart for Rome. Morse’s group restored the space to its original splendor, so guests who find it can sip coffee and act pontifical.

That said, anyone rushing out specifically to eat and drink should save themselves the hour-long Lyft ride for now.

So … it’s bad?

It’s not bad, but it’s all incredibly ambitious and, at least in the early going, everyone is very clearly getting up to speed. To put it less charitably: During the hotel’s first full day in business, the place was a mess. The main restaurant refused to seat anyone without a reservation, and the bar wasn’t able to actually serve many people — including some unlucky souls who arrived to learn their rooms also were not yet ready.

Tell me more about this bar. How could it not be ready?

It’s a big deal. The bar, henceforth known as the Sunken Lounge, which is run by the Gerber Group (the same people who recently revamped the Campbell in Grand Central Terminal). It resembles, as the name indicates, a giant “conversation pit,” decked out with chili-pepper-red carpet, a black Solari di Udine flight board, and red-upholstered Saarinen tulip stools. “The simplicity,” Scott Gerber boasts, “is what makes it so spectacular.”

The drinks are all airport-themed — the Come Fly With Me involves vodka, St. Germain, prosecco, and lime; a $20, vodka-based Sunken Lounge Martini comes with flight wings — but Grub Street’s calls for a proper Aviation were met only with apologies from a bartender who said the bar was not yet stocking any crème de violette, a crucial ingredient. (The bar’s food is similarly straightforward: a pretzel, some hummus, or a charcuterie plate.)

There’s no denying that the lounge is an extremely handsome place to drink, but you won’t find anything here that you can’t also get at any decent cocktail bar in Manhattan.

Doesn’t Jean-Georges have a restaurant, too?

He does, and it is very pink. Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s 200-seat redo of the Paris Café is being touted as his first hotel restaurant — which isn’t technically true, since, for example, his flagship Jean-Georges is in the Trump International Hotel — but it’s definitely his first airport restaurant, and, as you might expect, he’s nostalgic for the days of luxury air travel: “Smoking was okay, there were massages, pedicures, manicures,” the chef says. “You could fly to L.A., and arrive as a new person! Well-fed, too!”

That’s fun! I love caviar and chicken Kiev!

We do, too, but hold on, because the early menu for the Paris Café is very much rooted in 2019 crowd-pleaser mode: burrata, fish tacos, and black-truffle pizza are all accounted for, and the restaurant is being called — you guessed it — an all-day café. “You can have an omelet in the afternoon, a burger for breakfast, or a steak with Café de Paris butter at 10 p.m.,” Vongerichten explains.

It still sounds better than a Sbarro.

That’s true, but if you’re looking for a full-on return to mid-century luxury dining, you’ll want to stick to the Grill or maybe Thomas Keller’s new TAK Room in Manhattan. Much like the Sunken Lounge, the Paris Café (and its sibling, the Lisbon Lounge) are decked-out in mid-century vibes, but are, for better or worse, designed to appeal to actual airline travelers of the 21st century.

So that’s it? One restaurant and one bar?

Hardly. There are wheeled coffee carts serving Intelligentsia, a food hall in the south wing called the Departures Dining Hall that features sandwiches, empanadas, etc., a rooftop lounge — also run by the Gerber Group — with an infinity pool overlooking the airport’s runways (!!!), and, oh yeah, another bar inside an actual plane.

What?

On the tarmac outside, you’ll find a refurbished L-1649A Starliner. “Connie,” as the 1958 Lockheed Constellation has been nicknamed, comfortably seats 30 guests.* A conveyor belt now ferries booze and ice to the bar, the cockpit was left intact for maximum Instagrammability, and the seats are originally from 1958. You can reserve tables for two or four up to 60 days in advance, and do not be surprised if this becomes a popular spot for private parties.

Look, I have to go to Orlando for work next week so I’ll be at the airport anyway — should I get there early to see this or not?

Yes! Sure! Probably! It really is like Mad Men brought to life. But even if it looks like 1962, it very much is still an airport hotel in 2019, so you may want to eat something before you get there.

246,BUSINESS,"In not a huge surprise, Aurora Cannabis (ACB) reported FQ3 numbers for the March quarter that missed analyst estimates. Also not a big surprise, the stock is flat to up on the miss. The numbers provide a crucial insight into the troubling sales of legalized cannabis in the Canadian adult-use market, but the company still has a huge market opportunity to spin the stock market back towards a positive long-term view.

For the quarter, Aurora reported revenues of C$65.1 million compared to estimates up at C$67.5 million. Typically, such a revenue miss would crush a company with a $9 billion market cap that is only delivering about $50 million in quarterly revenues, but a lot of the global market opportunity isn’t open yet including consumables in Canada.

The market is quickly looking past the quarter despite the company reporting a large EBITDA loss of C$36.6 million. The big issue with the Canadian companies is the push for wide global expansion that has a company like Aurora spending wild on future sales that aren’t guaranteed. For this reason, SG&A expenses were C$67.1 million in the quarter; though relatively flat from the prior quarter.

A couple of key figures for the quarter are the gross margin and the average net selling price. In FQ3, Aurora saw the gross margin rise slightly to 55% and the selling price per gram dipped 6% sequentially to C$6.40 per gram. The weakness here is problematic with a ton of additional supply hitting the market over the next year.

The question Aurora hasn’t really answered for investors is what happens with the additional supply hitting the market this quarter and in the future. The large cannabis company has long projected reaching an annual production rate of 150,000 kg by the end of March and still maintains 25,000 kgs on the market in the June quarter.

The large cannabis company harvested 15,590 kgs in the March quarter, up from 7,822 kgs in the December quarter. The FQ3 kgs sold was 9,160, up from 6,999 kgs in the previous quarter.

Both numbers were substantially above prior year levels, but the key is what happens when the current quarter inventory supplies are 150% more than the amount sold in the March quarter. The average net selling price per gram dipped 20% from last FQ3 to C$6.40 per gram.

The company is still promoting the concept of Aurora being EBITDA positive in the June quarter. The stock price would’ve taken a hit, if management walked back from this target, but closing the gap on a C$36.6 million EBITDA loss is an incredible amount and requires strong pricing in the cannabis sector.

Aurora didn’t really quantify the need for raising their total projected capacity from 500K kg to 625K kg back in early April. The company is still harping on the potential upside that comes from Ontario opening up additional retail stores and the consumables market opening up in October. The company plans to set aside some of the inventory to build supplies for the vapes and edibles products when the market opens up new revenue streams later this year.

The key investor takeaway is that Aurora remains in a precarious position where the company will have a difficult time maintaining previous lofty projections despite the suggestions otherwise with the FQ3 results. With about 1.1 billion shares outstanding and an additional at-the-market offering open for C$400 million worth of shares, the stock has a market value of ~$9 billion with additional dilution on the way.

The risk to the downside wasn’t eliminated with this report. If management ever confirms some of the worst fears regarding pricing, mounting losses and wild capacity expansion, the stock will get crushed. For now, Aurora is getting a pass for missing estimates, but this positive outcome won’t always occur.

247,BUSINESS,"J.P. Morgan Chase is buying medical payments technology firm InstaMed to push more deeply into the $3.5 trillion market for U.S. health-care spending.

The bank agreed on Friday to purchase the Philadelphia-based company of about 300 employees that processed $94 billion in transactions last year, according to the two companies.

J.P. Morgan is paying more than $500 million for the business, making it the lender's largest takeover since buying Bear Stearns and the bank assets of Washington Mutual in 2008, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

The move shows that the nation's largest bank views the fast-changing world of payments as a battleground worthy of aggressive wagers. When it comes to keeping pace with emerging technology in lending or investing, J.P. Morgan has typically partnered with fintech firms like OnDeck or used its own engineers to build solutions like the brokerage app YouInvest.

But payments, being transformed by global technology giants and surging due to the rise of e-commerce, offers a rare growth opportunity for banks. In fact, one of J.P. Morgan's only other sizable acquisitions of the past decade was its 2017 purchase of WePay, a competitor to PayPal and Stripe. (That year, J.P. Morgan also weighed a bid for Worldpay, a merchant acquirer, before a competitor bought it for $9.9 billion.)

So last year, J.P. Morgan surveyed the health-care landscape for ways to ramp up investment, according to Takis Georgakopoulos, the bank's head of wholesale payments. The decision was based on the vast size and complexity of the market: U.S. health spending, pegged at $3.5 trillion in 2017, is projected to reach $6 trillion by 2027, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",JP Morgan buys health-care payments firm InstaMed in the bank's biggest acquisition since the financial crisis

250,BUSINESS,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A California cafe is brewing up what it calls the world's most expensive coffee — at $75 a cup.

Klatch Coffee is serving the exclusive brew, the Elida Natural Geisha 803, at its branches in Southern California and San Francisco.

The 803 in the coffee's name refers to the record-breaking $803 per pound the organic beans sold for at a recent auction after winning the Best of Panama coffee competition, said Bo Thiara, co-owner of the Klatch branch in San Francisco. He calls the annual competition the coffee world's equivalent of the Oscars.

Only 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of the beans were available for purchase, and most went to Japan, China and Taiwan, Thiara said. Klatch secured 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) and is the only chain in North America to have it.

The coffee's high quality and limited supply set off a bidding war that determined its astronomical price, topping last year's winning beans that sold for $601 per pound, Thiara said.

Klatch describes the coffee as a rare variety of Arabica from Panama that has a floral, tea-like flavor with hints of jasmine and berries. The 10 pounds of beans will produce about 80 cups of coffee, Thiara said.

A few lucky coffee lovers got to try free samples Wednesday at the San Francisco branch, where promotional signs are on display advertising, ""World's Most Expensive Coffee.""

One of them was San Francisco resident Lauren Svensson, who said it was ""very different"" from any coffee she'd ever tasted.

""My mind was a little blown about the fact that a$75 cup of coffee even exists,"" she said, ""but it was shockingly good.""

Her friend, Charlie Sinhaseni, also gave his free sample a positive review.

252,BUSINESS,"Gannett Co. fended off a hostile takeover by MediaNews Group, which tried to install three directors on the newspaper chain's board Thursday to push through its $1.36 billion purchase offer.

It was a bid the McLean, Va.-based company's board rejected three months ago, noting that MediaNews had said it planned to borrow money to pay for the takeover but hadn't even contacted any potential financiers.

MediaNews responded by asking shareholders to elect three of its nominees to Gannett's board, which hires the CEO and sets the company's strategic direction. That would have given the would-be acquirer control of almost half the eight-member panel, a possibility shareholders rejected during a vote at Thursday's annual meeting.

Instead, according to a preliminary tally of votes, investors backed up Gannett's decision, electing all eight of the company's nominees.

[Related: Trust in media hits bottom, 60 percent say sources pay for stories]

""This outcome demonstrates that Gannett shareholders recognize the continued progress we have made toward our ongoing digital transformation and agree that our strategic plan is the best path to deliver value for all Gannett shareholders,"" the newspaper chain said afterward.

Gannett's board had argued the offer from MediaNews, which included a $254 million premium, undervalued a company using established brands in areas from Detroit to Phoenix and central Florida to attract and retain consumers shifting from print to digital news products.

“This is a win for an entrenched Gannett board that has been unwilling to address the current realities of the newspaper business, and sadly a loss for Gannett and its shareholders,"" said MediaNews, which holds a 7.4% stake in the company.

“Gannett’s newspapers are critical local resources, and we hope that Gannett’s incumbent board and management shift course to embrace a modern approach to local news that will save newspapers and serve communities,"" MediaNews added.

Otherwise, the snubbed suitor said, ""we believe the stock will drop further.” The shares tumbled 1.4% on Thursday alone, widening the decline over the past year to 24%.

While the newspaper industry faces an array of challenges, Gannett Chairman J. Jeffry Louis maintained that existing management has the expertise needed to navigate them and grow.

The firm comprises publishing operations separated from the broadcasting business of a once-larger company that bore the same name; the TV operation is now known as Tegna.

Gannett's revenue has declined about 12% in the past five years, dipping to $2.92 billion at the end of 2018, as newspapers struggle with the loss of advertisers who can promote their products more effectively, and less expensively, online.

254,BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. long-term mortgage rates fell slightly this week, marking a third straight week of declines as a continued inducement to purchasers in the spring homebuying season.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage eased to 4.07% from 4.10% last week. By contrast, a year ago the benchmark rate stood at 4.61%.

The average rate for 15-year, fixed-rate home loans declined this week to 3.53% from 3.57% last week.

The continuing U.S.-China trade war kicked into a fevered battle this week as high-level talks between the two sides broke down Friday and the Trump administration slapped new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated on Monday with increased tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. products. That sent stock prices tumbling around the globe; the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points as nervous investors shifted money from volatile stocks to the bond market.

Bond yields fall as prices rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates, was 2.37% late Wednesday, down sharply from 2.48% a week earlier. It rose to 2.41% Thursday morning.

With mortgage rates at historically low levels and positive economic signs, Freddie Mac is expecting home sales to increase this summer. ""While signals from the financial markets are flashing caution signs, the real economy remains on solid ground with steady job growth and five-decade low unemployment rates,"" Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said.

Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week to compile its mortgage rate figures.

The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates.

The average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was unchanged this week at 0.5 point.

The average fee for the 15-year mortgage held at 0.4 point.

The average rate for five-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 3.66% from 3.63% last week. The fee remained at 0.4 point.

255,BUSINESS,"Running a supermarket in America has never been harder.

Profits are razor thin. Online shopping and home delivery are changing the way people buy their food. Dollar stores and drugstores are selling more groceries. Pressures are so intense that regional chains like Southeastern Grocers, the owner of Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo, filed for bankruptcy. Large companies increasingly control the industry, which had long operated as a dispersed network of smaller, local grocers. And even Walmart — the largest player of all — faces new competition from Amazon, which bought Whole Foods in 2017 for almost $14 billion.

But when Walmart’s US CEO Greg Foran invokes words like “fierce,” “good” and “clever” in speaking almost admiringly about one of his competitors, he’s not referring to Amazon. He isn’t pointing to large chains like Kroger or Albertsons, dollar stores like Dollar General or online entrants like FreshDirect and Instacart.

Foran is describing Aldi, the no-frills German discount grocery chain that’s growing aggressively in the United States and reshaping the industry along the way.

New customers may be jolted at first by the experience of shopping at an Aldi, which expects its customers to endure a number of minor inconveniences not typical at other American grocery stores. Shoppers need a quarter to rent a shopping cart. Plastic and paper bags are available only for a fee. And at checkout, cashiers hurry shoppers away, expecting them to bag their own groceries in a separate location away from the cash register.

But Aldi has built a cult-like following. When it enters a new town, it’s not uncommon for hundreds of people to turn out for the grand opening. The allure is all in the rock-bottom prices, which are so cheap that Aldi often beats Walmart at its own low-price game.

""I am willing to do the extra work because the prices are amazing,” said Diane Youngpeter, who runs a fan blog about the grocer called the Aldi Nerd and an Aldi Facebook group with 50,000 members. “There’s a lot of Aldi nerds out there,” she said. “I didn’t realize that there were so many of us.”

Aldi has more than 1,800 stores in 35 states and is focused on growing in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, Florida and California. It’s on track to become America’s third largest supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kroger, with 2,500 stores by the end of 2022. Its close competitor Lidl, another German grocer with a similar low-cost business model, is racing to grow in the United States, too.

Amid their aggressive growth push, the two discount chains have forced the rest of the grocery industry to make big changes to hold onto their customers. Aldi has even encroached on Walmart’s turf— literally. As if throwing down a gauntlet, in October Aldi opened a store in Bentonville, Arkansas, just a mile from Walmart’s corporate headquarters.

""I never underestimate them,"" Foran said at an industry conference in March. “I've been competing against Aldi for 20-plus years. They are fierce and they are good.”

But as competitors fight back, can the company hold on to its low-cost advantage? Can it stick to what it calls the “Aldi way?”

The Aldi way: How the chain beats Walmart on price

There’s no secret to how Aldi keeps its prices so low: The company strips down the shopping experience in an unapologetically and brutally efficient way.

“They are able to drive out every fractional cent of cost without compromising on quality,” said Katrijn Gielens, professor of marketing at UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School.

Aldi is privately held, and through a spokesperson, the company declined to make its executives available for interviews. But Gielens estimates that its operating costs are about half those of mainstream retailers. The company also operates at a lower profit margin than competitors, she said.

From a customer’s point of view, the distinct experience starts at the shopping carts, which Aldi keeps locked up.

Rather than employ a team of runners to retrieve carts from the parking lot all day, Aldi expects its customers to return carts to the store after each shopping trip. It forces that behavior by charging customers a quarter deposit that they get back when they return their carts.

This is not a novel idea. Several American grocers tried it in the 1980s and 1990s, but abandoned the practice after it annoyed customers who had come to expect more services at their grocery stores. Aldi, which opened its first US store in Iowa in 1976, has stuck with the model, insisting the deposit system is key to its low-price strategy. The store’s most die-hard fans even celebrate it, heralding when Aldi offers “quarter keeper” keychains from time to time. Some fans even knit their own versions. A search on Etsy for “Aldi quarter keeper” turns up more than 500 results.

When customers enter stores, they’ll notice they look almost nothing like traditional supermarkets in the United States. With five or six super-wide aisles, Aldi only stocks around 1,400 items — compared to around 40,000 at traditional supermarkets and more than 100,000 at Walmart supercenters.

For time-strapped shoppers like Youngpeter, Aldi’s simple layouts and limited selection save her time. “I’m a busy mom. I don’t have time to navigate a huge grocery store with kids begging to get out and go home,” she said. “I can get in and out of an Aldi in no time. I’m not sifting through 50 different varieties of salsa.”

And good luck trying to find major name brands. More than 90% of the brands Aldi sells are its own private labels like Simply Nature organic products, Millville cereals, Burman’s ketchup and Specially Selected bread. (If this sounds like Trader Joe’s, that’s not a coincidence. The two companies share a common history.)

The packaging on these items sometimes looks so similar to brand-name alternatives that customers find themselves doing a double-take. Aldi's Honey Nut Crispy Oats, for example, come in a box nearly the same shades of orange, yellow and brown as General Mills’ Honey Nut Cheerios, and with a similar font, too. Aldi sells its Tandil laundry detergent in an orange plastic jug with blue and yellow graphics reminiscent of Tide. The Millville Toaster Tarts, an Aldi house brand, look strikingly similar to Pop-Tarts — but a 12-pack of the Millville version is $1.85 while a 12-pack of Pop-Tarts costs $2.75.

“I’m like, ‘these corn flakes are just as good, if not better, than the ones that have a chicken on the box! They’re the same exact ones,’” said Allison Robicelli, a food writer in Baltimore who describes herself as an Aldi loyalist.

Although it may not be obvious at first glance, Aldi employs several key design details that maximize efficiency at checkout, too. On many of its products, barcodes are either supersized or printed on multiple sides to speed up the scanning process. After groceries are rung up, there’s nowhere for them to linger. The cashier drops them directly into a shopping cart below. Aldi doesn’t waste time bagging groceries. Customers must wheel away their shopping carts to bag their own groceries in a separate section at the front. Since stores don’t offer free bags, customers often scour the store for empty cardboard boxes to use instead.

“Those lines fly. You’re not waiting for people to bag. They’re not messing around there,” said Robicelli. “Once you see that kind of efficiency, it makes going to other supermarkets really annoying and really tedious.”

Aldi has other tactics to keep real estate and labor costs down. Size is one factor. A Walmart supercenter averages around 178,000 square feet. Costco warehouses average around 145,000 square feet. Aldi’s small box stores, however, take up just a fraction of that space, at 12,000 square feet on average.

And unlike other stores, where there’s a clear division of labor — runners retrieve carts, cashiers ring up customers and clerks stock shelves — Aldi employees are cross-trained to perform every function. Their duties are also streamlined. Aldi displays products in their original cardboard shipping boxes, rather than stacking them individually, to save employees time stocking shelves. Most stores don’t list their phone numbers publicly because Aldi doesn’t want its workers to spend time answering calls.

The result: A single Aldi might have only three to five employees in the store at any given time, and only 15 to 20 on the entire payroll. The company claims to pay its workers above the industry average, but still saves on overall labor costs simply by having fewer people.

All of these cost savings add up and are passed on to customers. Aldi claims its prices are up to 50% cheaper than traditional supermarkets, and independent analysis by Wolfe Research shows its prices are around 15% cheaper than Walmart in markets like Houston and Chicago.

""They've driven prices down, cleverly,"" Walmart's Foran said. Last year, he noted that when he visited Aldi, a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs each cost 99 cents. Foran said he and his team could not risk losing on those popular items.

Despite the stripped-down store experience, Aldi scores higher on customer satisfaction surveys and benefits far more from word-of-mouth marketing than Walmart and other supermarkets. It has one of the highest Net Promoter Scores — a key measure of how likely customers are to recommend the brand to their friends and family — in the grocery industry, according to Bain & Company.

Cheap kombucha on the shelves, BMWs in the parking lots

After Aldi first entered the United States, it took two decades for the company to expand to 500 stores.

Now, in its rapid growth phase, Aldi is on track to open more than 130 new stores just this year alone.

The Great Recession and its slow recovery helped the discount grocer gain popularity among budget-conscious shoppers in the United States. Aldi’s latest expansion builds on that momentum. ""Over the last 10 years, they’ve really flourished in the US,” said Mikey Vu, partner at Bain. “There’s instability in the economy. People are worried. They’re paying much closer attention to pennies on their grocery purchases than ever before.”

Of course, Aldi is not the only discount store growing in retail. TJMaxx, Ross and Burlington are all opening new doors, and their cheap prices have put pressure on department stores. Ollie’s Bargain Outlet and Five Below are growing rapidly. Dollar General has opened up thousands of stores in recent years.

For Aldi, part of its success lies in appealing not only to low or mid-income shoppers, but to wealthier ones as well. Aldi’s core shopper tends to make more money and have a slightly higher education level than the overall grocery shopper, according to Bain. On a recent trip to an Aldi in Hackensack, New Jersey, luxury vehicles, including a $50,000 Jaguar and an $80,000 Tesla Model X, dotted the small parking lot alongside Toyotas, Fords and Hondas. Walmart’s Foran has marveled that when he visited an Aldi in Australia, BMWs and Mercedes were in the parking lot there, too.

“People love saving money on staples. And it would apply to every single person in this room,” he said to an audience of investors and retail executives at a Four Seasons Hotel in Boston. “You feel pretty good if you can save $10 on your grocery bill because it makes you feel better when you go out for dinner on Saturday night and spend $200 at a restaurant.”

In recent years, Aldi has ramped up its efforts to appeal to high-income shoppers by offering more fresh, organic produce as well as imported items like Irish cheese, brioche from France and pastas from Italy. The stores now offer private-label versions of kombucha, cold-pressed juices, an array of gluten-free products and peanut butter powder.

Aldi is investing $1.9 billion to remodel 1,300 stores with natural lighting and refreshed produce, diary and meat sections. Since 2017, its new stores have been concentrated in more populous, upper middle-class suburbs, according to Bain. Aldi’s new stores are in zip codes with a $65,822 household income on average — about $4,500 above the national average. “They’re clearly trying to go after a more upmarket customer,” Vu said.

Part of Aldi’s appeal is not in a lower grocery bill alone, but in the way Aldi cleverly markets its discounts, UNC’s Gielens said. Bargain hunters across the income ladder end up feeling like they’re outsmarting other, higher-priced supermarkets and big brands when they see their grocery receipts. Aiming to be the ""smart shopping alternative,” Aldi wants to ""spread the message that traditional grocers and brands simply rip off consumers,” she said.

Aldi hammers home that message on its signs in stores. “The same is always better when it costs less.” “New deals every week. Find them here. Brag like crazy.” Aldi encourages customers to ditch their grocery stores: “Switch and save.”

Americans are listening. Last year, 19% of shoppers who switched retailers started buying at Aldi, according to a Morgan Stanley survey. That was second only to Walmart.

Aldi’s reliance on private-label brands is also helping it win Millennials, who are increasingly brand-agnostic and are instead drawn to lower prices and convenience, according to Bain data. Private-label products have undergone a renaissance in recent years and are now growing faster at supermarkets than the top 20 national brands, Nielsen data shows.

Stores like Trader Joe’s and Costco have built empires selling their own brands. Costco’s Kirkland Signature, for example, raked in nearly $40 billion last year, an 11% increase from 2017. Kirkland’s sales last year beat out Campbell Soup, Kellogg and Hershey put together. Retailers’ brands challenge these consumer goods heavyweights, which spend billions marketing their products.

“It used to be the white label knock-off stuff that you were a little bit embarrassed to buy, but it was cheap,” Vu said of store brands. Now, Bain customer surveys show that 85% of US shoppers say they’re open to trying private label products. “People don't care anymore about the big brands the way they used to,"" he said. ""That plays right into the Aldi playbook.""

It all began with a thrifty family

Aldi’s obsession with frugality comes from its early owners: brothers Theo and Karl Albrecht, who took over the family grocery business in Essen, Germany after World War II. Out of necessity, early stores initially stocked only a handful of items, but the brothers planned to expand the selection as the business grew. Over time, however, they recognized that they could be successful selling a narrow range of basics. “If we did not want to offer customers a wide range of products, then we had at least to offer them some other advantage. From that point on, we sold our products for decisively less,” Karl said in 1953, according to a book by former Aldi manager Dieter Brandes.

Theo was so insistent on keeping costs low that he was known to take notes on both sides of a piece of paper and to turn off the lights at stores during the daytime. The brothers purposefully kept store aesthetics to a Spartan minimum. “There are no decorations in stores,” Karl said in 1953. “All of our promotional efforts are put into discount prices.”

In 1961, the brothers split the business in two, reportedly over a dispute over whether to sell cigarettes in stores. Karl took southern Germany, and Theo ran the North. To this day, Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord remain separate companies, with the dividing line between the two in Germany known as the “Aldi Equator.”

Aldi Süd is the company that’s expanding rapidly now in the United States, as well as throughout Europe. Aldi Nord also has an American presence through Trader Joe’s, which it acquired in 1979 — but its growth is less ambitious than that of its cousin company. Trader Joe’s had 484 stores in United States at the end of 2018.

The Albrecht brothers both passed away within the last decade. Now, the two chains operate in 18 countries, bringing in an estimated $98 billion in combined sales last year, according to Deloitte. That revenue makes the Aldi companies not only one of the largest grocers, but also the eighth biggest retailer in the world. The two Aldis combined are now larger than CVS or Tesco, and just a few rungs down from Amazon, Home Depot and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Aldi Süd’s rapid growth in the United States mimics its broader international expansion in places like Ireland, Hungary, Switzerland, Australia and even China. The company has also grown quickly in the United Kingdom, where many local grocers ignored Aldi until it was too late.

But as Aldi scales in the United States, there are real concerns about whether it can maintain its low-cost advantage. American competitors have learned to respond faster when Aldi lowers prices, which could blunt its impact.

“They’ve taken Aldi as a much more credible threat,” Vu said.

Walmart has narrowed its price gap with Aldi since July 2017, according to a study conducted by Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin, who recorded prices of 40 top-selling items at a Houston Walmart and an Aldi across the street from one another. Walmart also narrowed that gap with Aldi in Chicago-area stores, he found.

To counter Walmart and other grocers’ moves, Aldi has started compromising its bare-bones approach. In September, it launched a national advertising campaign, including television commercials, to drive the message that it sells high-quality products. Aldi also recently pledged to cut plastic and transition to 100% sustainable packaging by 2025 — not a cheap endeavor. Aldi increased its fresh food offerings by 40% in 2018 by expanding its produce selection and adding new vegan and vegetarian options. And it started offering more alternative milks, including soy and almond.

Those changes are expensive and could eat away at Aldi’s margins. “The model only works if they are the actual cheapest,” said Simon Johnstone, analyst at Kantar.

Customers also say they’re starting to notice a few more brand-name goods on the shelves, such as Coca-Cola, Tide and Old Spice deodorant. “I honestly don’t like it when they bring in national brands. I like the sanctity of Aldi,” Robicelli said, adding that she worries prices might go up.

At the same time, Aldi faces heightened competition from its closest rival, Lidl. Lidl cut the ribbon on its first US stores in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina in 2017 and recently opened three stores outside of Atlanta. It’s expanding in upper income communities, too. Now, Lidl operates more than 60 stores in the country.

Aldi is closely monitoring Lidl’s growth. In a federal lawsuit filed in March, Aldi alleged that two of its former US employees illegally shared confidential information about its sales, future store locations and real estate strategy with Lidl.

A spokesperson for Lidl said the company ""believes in fair competition and the allegations in the lawsuit are not consistent with our business practices and values. We are looking into the claims, which we take seriously.""

Although huge competitors can reduce prices to compete with Aldi, regional supermarkets are getting squeezed by the grocery price war.

Tops Markets and Southeastern Grocers, the owner of Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo, have recently filed for bankruptcy. Save-A-Lot, the second-largest discount grocery chain in the United States after Aldi, is deep in debt and can’t afford to continue lowering prices without sacrificing profit.

“Aldi and Lidl will be a significant disrupting force in the US, threatening smaller regional supermarket chains and forcing larger players to cut prices,” Fitch Solutions said in a research report in March.

More bankruptcies are on the way for America’s grocery stores, analysts predict. ""The US has a much bigger tranche of second and third tier grocery retailers,” said Vu from Bain. “Those are the ones that are dying off.”

With smaller grocers disappearing, there’s probably room for both Walmart and Aldi to pick up the pieces, Vu added. In the meantime, Aldi will keep leading the price wars, putting pressure on the bigger players, too.

257,BUSINESS,"American Airlines has won tentative approval to launch daily flights as soon as next summer from DFW International Airport to Japan's Haneda International Airport -- a coveted route for business and leisure travelers because of its downtown Tokyo location.

The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Thursday that it's tentatively awarding daytime Haneda slots to American to begin service from DFW and add a second daily flight from Los Angeles International Airport.

""We are encouraged by the DOT's tentative decision,"" said American Airlines President Robert Isom in a statement. ""We understand the unique opportunity we've been granted with new Haneda service from our largest hub at DFW and additional service from LAX, and will deliver a world-class customer experience when flights begin next year.""

American launched LAX-to-Haneda service in 2016 and has been trying to gain additional slots. It had wanted to add two flights from DFW, citing high demand from business travelers following a flood of investment by Japanese companies in North Texas.

Earlier this year, Japan agreed to open 12 additional daytime slots to U.S. carriers in part because the country is hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics. Besides the two slots tentatively awarded to American, the transportation department also doled out five slots to Delta, four to United and one to Hawaiian Airlines. Those flights would depart from these U.S. airports:

Delta, in a statement, praised the decision as a ""major milestone"" that benefits travelers by increasing competition. The Atlanta-based carrier said it'll be able to compete more effectively with U.S. airlines, such as American, that have joint venture partnerships with Japanese airlines.

""This preliminary order demonstrates the DOT's commitment to encouraging competition and providing more choice for customers traveling between the U.S. and Tokyo's city center,"" said Delta executive Steve Sear.



Delta already has service to Haneda from Los Angeles and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Tokyo's other major airport, Narita, can increase travel time by up to two hours to the city's downtown.

258,BUSINESS,"Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's oldest daughter and a White House adviser, said she wants everyone to change how they think about learning.

During a panel discussion with individuals who have participated in Salesforce’s Trailhead training program, Ivanka Trump talked Thursday morning about how her goal is to make sure everyone has ongoing access to training opportunities. The jobs of the future are often unknown, she said, and that means learning can't take place during just one period of a person's life.

“We constantly have to be sharpening our skills,” Trump said.

The event at Salesforce Tower was part of Salesforce’s inaugural Trailblazer Day, an event to recognize some of the lifelong learners in the company's workforce. During the event, Salesforce signed the Trump administration’s Pledge to America’s Workers, a committment to help 500,000 workers earn the credentials and skills they need to obtain jobs in the Salesforce ecosystem over the next five years.

The Pledge to America’s Workers initiative was launched last year. It asks companies and trade groups to commit to expanding programs that educate, train and re-skill American workers from high school to near-retirement.

Walmart, FedEx, IBM, Apple, Lockheed and Boeing are among the more than 200 companies that already have signed on to the initiative. Salesforce had previously committed to training 8,000 workers.

Trump said Salesforce’s Trailhead program is one example of how the private sector is helping people learn the skills they need to obtain better jobs.

In November 2017, Salesforce—in partnership with Deloitte—launched the initiative, officially known as the Salesforce Pathfinder Training Program. It is a four-month long course focused on training individuals in soft skills, business acumen and effective communication for jobs in software development and data management.

Trump also talked about the need to close the gender pay gap and establish better family-leave policies.

“We really think we’re just at the beginning of this mission,” Trump said.

Salesforce Chairman Marc Benioff, who moderated the panel discussion, thanked Trump for her commitment to improving and expanding workforce training opportunities.

“We know that you’re our advocate,” Benioff said.

259,BUSINESS,"(Reuters) - Pinterest Inc on Thursday forecast 2019 revenue broadly in line with Wall Street targets, disappointing investors who had expected more from the freshly public, high flying stock, and sending its shares down 16 percent.

The online scrapbook company’s shares have risen 62% from its initial public offering price of $19 last month.

“Clearly the after-hours pullback is a reflection of investor expectations being too high heading into the quarter,” DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.

Pinterest’s sales outlook was a disappointment said Forte, especially given the high expectations reflected in the run up in shares.

The company expects full-year revenue between $1.055 billion and $1.08 billion, the mid point of which is slightly above analysts’ estimate of $1.06 billion, driven by average revenue per user (ARPU) in the United States.

Pinterest also said in a regulatory filing it would look to invest in its advertising products through the year.

The company, which calls its users “pinners”, added 291 million monthly active users globally in the first quarter, above estimates of 289.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ARPU globally rose 26% to 73 cents, the company said.

Net loss narrowed to $41.4 million in the quarter ended March 31 from $52.7 million a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the company lost 32 cents per share.

Total revenue rose about 54% to $201.9 million, beating estimates of $200.6 million.

Unlike Pinterest, other companies that made their stock market debut in 2019 such as Lyft Inc and Uber Technologies Inc have seen a steep drop. Uber shares have fallen nearly 18% since its IPO, while Lyft is down about 23%.",Pinterest shares plummet on disappointing 2019 revenue forecast
260,BUSINESS,"The biggest crypto analyst on YouTube says he believes the recent drop in the price of Bitcoin will continue.

Nicholas Merten (aka DataDash) says he expects a 40% correction in the recent parabolic rise of BTC, bringing the price to about $5,000 in the weeks ahead.

“This is a very key level because once we got up above $5,000 as we were setting up higher levels, we continuously tested this level. And that’s exactly what we did back here [in late 2015]. Again, you can see, before we entered a big bulk of that fast moving price action, going vertical in a sense, we had a test on that level. We tested it multiple times after we came back down. So the least I would expect is that we could come back down to that $5,000 level and test it multiple times. As we’ve seen this kind of parabolic rise in price action, this would line up perfectly with previous lows. So as we go into the end of May and into early June, I would expect we’re going to come down here into this range and hold…

I can tell you all, anywhere between $5,000 and $5,500, I’m buying. I’m averaging down. I’m getting ready to prepare for this market run-up. But I’m going to have to see price come down to a lower level. NVT, RSI, everything is telling me it’s too overbought personally. As much as I love the cryptocurrency space, as much as I love Bitcoin, and I know it could be worth $1 million one day most likely, in the short term this is too much for me.”

Right now, Bitcoin is down 11.08% at $7,105 according to Coin360, posting a steep decline since Wednesday, May 15 when BTC was trading at $8,300. The downturn has dragged the altcoins into double-digit negative territory. Ethereum is down 15.55% at $230.47, and XRP is down 13.18% at $0.3723.

262,BUSINESS,"Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) plans to argue that a $2B jury award and thousands of U.S. lawsuits claiming its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer should be rejected because the Environmental Protection Agency said the herbicide is not a public health risk, Reuters reports.

The company says it will argue that the lawsuits, which are brought under state law, conflict with guidance from the federal EPA; state law claims are barred if they conflict with federal law under the legal doctrine of preemption, which is considered a ""silver bullet defense"" because it stops claims across the board.

But some legal experts believe Bayer faces a big hurdle convincing appeals courts that the EPA's determination that the glyphosate chemical in Roundup shields it from state law claims.

The company could have a better chance of winning if a business friendly U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, but that could take years.

Bayer has come under increasing pressure after a third U.S. jury earlier this week found Roundup to be carcinogenic, awarding more than $2B to a couple who used the chemical on their property in the largest verdict so far in glyphosate litigation.",Bayer to bet on 'silver bullet' defense in Roundup litigation - Reuters
263,BUSINESS,"Lilium's all-electric jet-powered flying car successfully completed take off and landing flight tests in Munich earlier this month as the German startup enters a race with Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY) and others to create an on-demand air taxi.

In recent tests, Lilium used a full-scale, full-weight prototype of its five-seater flying car, which took off and landed vertically. The flying car is uses 36 all-electric jet engines for its VOTL capability.

""Today we are taking another huge step toward making urban air mobility a reality,"" CEO and co-founder Daniel Wiegand said in a release. ""In less than two years we have been able to design, build and successfully fly an aircraft that will serve as our template for mass production.""

The flying car can be operated with a pilot or as a drone to take advantage of paying customers in all five seats. Lilium expects the flying taxi to be operational in cities by 2025. It has a nearly 200 mile range and could link cities like New York and Boston or Washington and Philadelphia.

But just short hops around cities could be lucrative. Lilium Chief Commercial Officer Remo Gerber told Bloomberg that it would cost around $70 to use the air taxi to fly from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan.

Lilium has started the approval process for European and U.S. regulators, the first electric jet to do so.

The air taxi and flying car market is crowded as startups and established aerospace and car companies invest in the technology. The flying car market and air taxi market could reach $615 billion-$2.9 trillion by 2040, according to Morgan Stanley estimates last year.

In January, Boeing's two-seater propeller-powered flying car completed a controlled takeoff, hover and landing but did not fly forward. The autonomous air taxi only has range of up to 50 miles.

Airbus is working with Volkswagen's Audi to design a flying car that can drive on the road and take flight. The European aerospace giant is also developing Vahana, an autonomous single-seat aircraft, and CityAirbus, a four-seat aircraft.

Textron (TXT) unit Bell is developing a hybrid air taxi that runs on both electricity and conventional fuel to give it a longer range.

265,BUSINESS,"Semiconductor-equipment supplier Applied Materials (AMAT) late Thursday beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal second quarter. The Applied Materials earnings report drove its stock higher in extended trading.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 70 cents a share on sales of $3.54 billion in the quarter ended April 28. Analysts expected Applied Materials earnings of 66 cents a share on sales of $3.48 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings per share fell 41% while sales dropped 23%.

For the current quarter, Applied Materials expects to earn an adjusted 71 cents a share on sales of $3.525 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance.

Wall Street was modeling Applied Materials earnings of 70 cents a share on sales of $3.567 billion, according to Zacks. However, Thomson Reuters put consensus estimates for the current quarter at 66 cents in earnings per share on sales of $3.51 billion.

Applied Materials stock jumped over 6% in after-hours trading on the stock market today. During the regular session, it climbed 0.4% to 41.66.

""In the second fiscal quarter Applied Materials delivered results toward the top-end of our guidance range, reflecting solid execution across the company in a business environment that remains challenging,"" Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said in a news release.

He added, ""Looking ahead, we maintain a positive view of our markets as powerful new demand drivers for semiconductors and displays take shape, creating tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials.""

266,BUSINESS,"Love it or hate it, share-plate dining is far from over. But dwindling are the days when tapas and small plates monopolized the category and each diner was encouraged to order five to six items.

Making waves today is large-format dining. From whole fish to whole roasted duck to steak for two or more, the new way of sharing food may have reached its pinnacle with a $1,200 tomahawk available in -- where else -- Las Vegas.

At MB Steak inside Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, this dry-aged, seven-boned tomahawk serves 12. Unlike your average steakhouse steak order, however, sides are included, making the hefty price tag for the 16-pound ribeye at least marginally more digestible.

Along with the massive cut of beef, tables are served an assortment of six decadent side dishes including lobster mac and cheese, creamed corn with king crab and roasted poblano, maitake mushrooms with aged goat cheese and creamed spinach with a poached egg and truffle gouda.

Chef Patrick Munster says one to two ""Feasts"" are ordered each week -- and the extra-large cuts must be pre-ordered as the restaurant requires advance notice to obtain the USDA Prime meat sourced from Nebraska. As is widely publicized the tomahawk can be enjoyed by up to 12 people, but Munster says he once served it to a table of eight, and the group finished it all.

MB Steak is owned by brothers David Morton and Michael Morton, part of Morton Group. The restaurant bills itself a ""luxury steakhouse"" though by many people's definition, steakhouses are already luxurious by default. A 22-ounce bone-in ribeye at Bavette's in Chicago, for example, will cost you $69.95; in Las Vegas, the price of the exact same steak curiously isn't listed on the website and costs significantly more at $91.

At The Grill, an upscale chophouse in Manhattan, the 14-ounce, dry-aged porterhouse is $74 -- in short, a lot more than your now relatively average $25-30 entree.

MB Steak's menu includes a few items from the sea: fennel crusted salmon, sea scallops and shrimp risotto are available on any given night, but who goes to a steakhouse and orders fish?

If you haven't had enough luck at the blackjack table to justify the tomahawk (or if you just can't fathom paying that much for a food item, no matter how delicious or deep your pockets), MB also has a number of ""signature steaks"" from which to choose.

267,BUSINESS,"You might only know Walmart as a place to stop to pick up milk or paper towels, maybe a few other things, on your way home from work. But the biggest retailer in the world is doing a lot more than just selling groceries — likely a lot of things you don't even realize.

CEO Doug McMillon says the company is on track to become more of a ""digital enterprise.""

It's testing a retail lab in New York using artificial intelligence. It recently, for an undisclosed amount, acquired Silicon Valley-based Polymorph labs, with the goal of using the start-up's technology to make advertising with Walmart easier for small brands.

In February, it bought Aspectiva, a start-up that looks at a customer's browsing behavior and helps make product recommendations, again not disclosing the cost of that deal.

It's adding veterinary clinics to its stores and runs an online pet pharmacy now. And it continues to incubate its own brands — during the latest quarter it launched one that sells home furniture, called MoDRN.

In many ways, Walmart is becoming more like Amazon, as Amazon becomes more like Walmart by opening stores and trying to sell more groceries. Both companies are trying to hold their own in the industry.

While Amazon accounts for roughly 50% of all e-commerce sales in the U.S., Walmart is gaining ground. It surpassed Apple in 2018 to become the third-largest online retailer in the country, trailing only Amazon and eBay, according to eMarketer.

In addition to all the work it's doing in its bricks-and-mortar stores, Walmart also thinks it can own a bigger and better advertising business, rivaling Amazon's.

Amazon last year became the third largest ad platform in the U.S., behind only Google and Facebook. With more and more shoppers going straight to Amazon, not Google, to start their product searches, the e-commerce giant gets the chance to advertise more. When consumers are ready to buy a specific product, 74% of them are going straight to Amazon to do it, according to a study by Feedvisor.

And so Walmart is looking to do the same. That's one reason it's trying to make its website more of a landing page for other well-known brands — so far, it's brought in Lord & Taylor, Fanatics and Advance Auto Parts to Walmart.com.

""As we think about new revenue and income streams, we know we can do more in the advertising space,"" McMillon said Thursday, as Walmart reported quarterly earnings.

Meanwhile, the company is going deep into tech. That's despite it recently losing its chief technology officer, Jeremy King, to Pinterest. King, who joined Walmart in 2011, had been overseeing much of Walmart's digital strategy and also heading up Walmart Labs, the company's technology arm. With his departure, Fiona Tan, senior vice president of customer technology, stepped up into an ""elevated role,"" according to Walmart.",Walmart's battle with Amazon has new fronts: Digital ads and A.I.
268,BUSINESS,"The European Commission said Thursday that it had fined Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland a combined 1.07 billion euros, about $1.2 billion , for their roles in foreign exchange trading cartels.

The penalty followed billions of dollars in fines that various government regulators levied on major banks in 2014 and 2015 over their participation in the manipulation of the foreign currency market.

The commission’s action stemmed from what it deemed to be anti-competitive practices by two cartels that operated from 2007 to 2013 . Previous related investigations by the Justice Department, and by regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland, examined criminal misconduct and civil violations and had increased scrutiny of currency trading desks.

“Foreign exchange spot trading activities are one of the largest markets in the world, worth billions of euros every day,” Margrethe Vestager , Europe’s commissioner for competition policy, said in a statement on Thursday. “The behavior of these banks undermined the integrity of the sector at the expense of the European economy and consumers.”",Europe Fines 5 Banks $1.2 Billion for Their Roles in Foreign Exchange Cartels

271,BUSINESS,"Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard said Thursday that the U.S. is in a ""new normal"" that requires the central bank to pursue higher inflation to ensure healthy growth, but also extra regulatory vigilance to prevent a financial crisis. 





The new normal, Brainard explained, is that very low unemployment hasn't translated into higher inflation, as would have been expected, even as the Fed's interest rate target is low by historical standards.

Brainard acknowledged the positive aspects of the new normal, such as the fact that low unemployment has generated jobs for disabled workers and others who might otherwise struggle to find positions, but warned that prevailing low interest rates could increase risk-taking by lenders and borrowers.

[ Related: Five for the Fed: A handful of people Trump may select for a seat]

""In today's new normal, it is important to achieve inflation and inflation expectations around our 2% target on a sustained basis while guarding against financial imbalances,"" Brainard said in remarks prepared for a speech to the National Tax Association in Washington. ""We want to be mindful of the risk of financial imbalances that could amplify any shock and help tip the economy into recession, which the Federal Reserve has less conventional space to address in today's low interest rate environment.""

Core inflation stood at 1.6% in the latest reading of the Fed's preferred gauge.

To adjust, she argued, the Fed should raise regulatory standards for banks, especially by raising capital requirements.

Specifically, Brainard reiterated a call to raise the Fed’s countercyclical capital buffer, a mechanism to make banks maintain higher levels of capital in case an economic downturn or other financial shock occurs. The Fed governor argued that activating the buffer could also serve as a brake to prevent banks from overextending themselves.

[ Also read: Trump: Stock market would be up 5K-10K points if Fed 'had done its job properly']

Brainard's prescription puts her in a minority on the Fed's board, which has aimed to tailor bank regulations to business activities along with the amount of capital banks are required to hold. But the Fed is wrestling with whether it needs to change its approach to monetary policy.

""The Federal Reserve has been ... discussing what this new normal means for our framework for some time,"" said Brainard. “[W]e need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can, while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework.""","Fed Gov.

272,BUSINESS,"A large media group has emerged as the sole qualified bidder to buy The Reading Eagle out of bankruptcy, the newspaper reported Thursday night.

MediaNews Group, which formerly operated under the name Digital First Media, submitted the only qualified bid to purchase the Reading Eagle Company, the newspaper reported. The Eagle reported there was one other unidentified bidder that was not qualified.

With only one qualified bidder, a planned auction for the company slated to take place Friday has been canceled, the Eagle reported. The Reading Eagle Company filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year amidst deep financial challenges.

Peter D. Barbey, president and CEO of Reading Eagle Company, said the bid from MediaNews “has neither been accepted nor rejected,” the Eagle reported, “and we continue to work with MediaNews Group/Digital First Media to resolve certain outstanding issues.”

MediaNews, based in Denver, Colo., owns the San Jose Mercury News, the Denver Post and many other news organizations nationwide. The company has bought a host of struggling newspapers and often engaged in deep cuts of newsroom staffs to reduce costs, industry analysts say.

Earlier this year, MediaNews attempted to acquire the Gannett newspaper chain, which publishes USA Today and more than 100 other papers, but that takeover bid was rejected. On Thursday, Gannett shareholders turned back an effort from MediaNews to win seats on the company’s board of directors, scuttling another attempt to acquire Gannett.

MediaNews is controlled by New York-based hedge fund Alden Global Capital. The company operates several papers in Pennsylvania, including The Mercury in Pottstown, The Times Herald in Norristown, and the Daily Local News in West Chester, among others.

The Eagle filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year in the wake of serious financial pressures, a common theme for newspapers nationwide in recent years.

On Wednesday, bankruptcy attorney Robert Lapowsky said “multiple bids” were received by Wednesday’s deadline but didn’t specify how many bids were submitted.

The Reading Eagle Co. issued a mass-layoff notice this week with the state Department of Labor and Industry. The company has 234 employees. A company official said the warning only indicated that layoffs were possible but not a certainty.

“Reading Eagle Company does not concede it is required to comply with WARN’s notice requirements at this time,” Jennie Priest, executive director-human resources, said in a statement on the paper’s website. “Nonetheless, we wanted our employees to be aware of the protections WARN offers in the event of a mass layoff, which, as of the date of the notice, is only possible, not probable.”

Federal law requires companies with 100 or more employees to give such notice if there may be a mass layoff affecting at least 33 percent of the workforce.

Six employees were laid off last week, according to The Reading Eagle.

In addition to the newspaper, The Reading Eagle Company owns radio station WEEU, based in Reading, and a weekly newspaper in Schuylkill County. Last year, the Reading Eagle celebrated the 150th anniversary of the newspaper’s founding.

The Reading Eagle has garnered recognition as one of Pennsylvania’s strongest newspapers, earning dozens of awards in newspaper contests in recent years.

Earlier this year, the Eagle won the top honors among newspapers in its size in the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association’s Keystone Press Awards. The Eagle has won the “sweepstakes” in its division for seven consecutive years.

274,BUSINESS,"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day on Thursday during a congressional hearing, pointing out that his pharmaceutical company charges nearly $2,000 to U.S. customers for Truvada, a drug designed to reduce the risk of HIV, while a generic version of the same drug only costs $8 in Australia.

""The current list price [of Truvada] is $2,000 a month in the United States, correct?"" the progressive Democratic Congresswoman from New York asked the Gilead CEO on Thursday during a congressional hearing. O’Day clarified that the list price is actually $1,780.

Ocasio-Cortez shot back: “Why is it $8 in Australia?”

O’Day explained that Truvada still has patent protection in the U.S. while it does not in the U.S. ""It will be generically available in the United States as of September 2020,” he said.

The congresswoman then lit into the CEO, arguing that the massive markup would cause people to die. She also explained that Gilead was charging Americans an exorbitant markup for the drug, despite the fact that research for Truvada was paid for by taxpayers and the patent is owned by the public.

""I think it's important here that we notice that we the public, we the people, developed this drug. We paid for this drug, we led and developed all the patents to create PrEP [the commonly known name for Truvada] and then that patent has been privatized, despite the fact that the patent is owned by the public, who refused to enforce it,"" the representative said.

“There’s no reason this should be $2,000 a month. People are dying because of it,” she added.

As Ocasio-Cortez explained, the research that showed Truvada was effective at preventing HIV in humans, despite a user's potentially risky sexual activity, was almost entirely funded by U.S. taxpayers, according to The Washington Post. The U.S. government patented the treatment back in 2015, but it currently does not receive any profit from the drug. Instead, Gilead, which originally developed the drug for other treatments, has argued that the patent is not valid and continues to rake in billions annually.

In fact, since Truvada was approved as an effective HIV treatment, Gilead has steadily increased its price. A 2018 report by NPR explained that the drug's wholesale price had increased 45 percent over the past six years. Although most health insurance in the U.S. covers Truvada, that does not benefit the millions of Americans who are not insured.

“With the amount of effort and time and taxpayer money that went into it, for CDC [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and Gilead not to come to an agreement, so the taxpayer could get some of that money, is really unconscionable,’’ Thomas Folks, who first researched Truvada’s ability to prevent HIV in monkeys, told the Post earlier this year.","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tells CEO: “people are dying” because he charges nearly $2,000 for HIV drug"

• Earlier this week, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a state-aligned Chinese tabloid, said Chinese scholars were looking into the possibility of China dumping US Treasurys.
• UBS looked at the Federal Reserve's tapering to try and figure out what kind of effect China selling $1.1 trillion of Treasurys would have on the bond market and concluded the 10-year yield could rise by up to 40 basis points.
• Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal thinks yields could actually fall if China sold its holdings.
• The debate is likely for naught as China needs to hold Treasurys, according to one analyst.

Chinese scholars are reportedly looking into the so-called nuclear option in the trade war — Beijing dumping US Treasurys.

""Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically,"" Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the state-aligned Chinese tabloid Global Times, tweeted on Monday, setting off a debate about what the consequences would be if China divested its holdings.

While UBS strategists think it's unlikely China would sell the entirety of its holdings, they looked into what could happen just in case. To do so, they looked at the effect the Fed's tapering had on yields.

""Through quantitative easing programs, the Fed expanded its balance sheet by about $3.5trn,"" the strategists wrote. ""We estimated that this compressed US term premium by about 110bp. Through its balance sheet unwind of $600bn, we estimated that 10-year term premium had risen by about 20-30bp.""

Therefore, they concluded that China unloading all $1.1 trillion of its Treasurys, or about 7% of the entire market, would cause the 10-year yield to climb by 30 to 40 basis points.

But not everyone agrees that yields would go higher. In Bloomberg's daily markets email, Joe Weisenthal, the executive editor for daily news, suggested Treasury yields could actually fall.

""What's more plausible than spiking yields is that if word got out that China really did want to dump U.S. debt in size,"" he wrote.

""Yields would fall because people would assume that this 'nuclear option' represented a gigantic break in the U.S.-Sino relationship. All that would hurt the global economy, causing the Fed to be even slower with expected rate hikes. In the immediate term, there would likely be a flight to Treasuries, amid a big risk-off move in markets. The Treasury market often behaves counterintuitively,"" he added.

Of course, the whole debate is likely for naught.

""What people don't understand is that it is not a choice"" for China to keep so many Treasurys, J Capital Research cofounder Anne Stevenson-Yang told Business Insider's Linette Lopez. ""This is a dollar world and China hold Treasurys to manage its trade with the world.""

276,BUSINESS,"What’s the absolute easiest way to unify America today? Go anti-robocall.



Not exactly a brave and controversial stance to condemn the most annoying phenomenon of our time, is it? The English language has a few verboten words. Lately, it seems that “robocall” is creeping up the rankings, alongside “taxes” and “moist.”

The numbers of robocalls grew an estimated 325 percent in 2018 to 85 billion spam calls, 26.3 billion of which were in America. The FCC itself recently cited a study saying half of all calls made to American cell phones this year will be spam. Put me on permanent silent mode, people.

Wait, hold on, not so fast, says Republican FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly.

“Repeat after me,” O’Rielly said on Thursday. “‘Robocall’ is not a bad word.”

O’Rielly spoke to an audience of debt collectors at ACA International. Debt collectors are one of the country’s most zealous users of robocalls, a tool they deploy to hound people in debt about their bills.

These are not the international and multilingual scams that have made robocalls so famous of late—by some counting, however, robocalls for debts and past-due bills are even more common, according to CNBC. The other great American robocallers: telemarketers. And who doesn’t love them?

Robocalls are a cheap and easy way to call people in debt, sometimes multiple times per day, in order to hound them into paying as quickly as possible. As O’Rielly explained in his speech, “the use of automated technology generally translates into lower costs, freeing up resources for more efficient uses, including lower prices.”

It costs debt collectors less than a penny per call, according to a recent report in CNBC.

For the past several years, the FCC has made it a priority to crack down on the scourge of illegal robocalling. The debt collector business, however, has found friendly ears at the regulatory agency. Since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the industry has lobbied the FCC to adjust its approach to call blocking and robocalls in order to let the debt collectors through.



The FCC is currently figuring out the scope of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. A recent D.C. Circuit Court decision pushed the FCC to revisit the rules governing robocalls under the TCPA. Industries like debt collectors and telemarketers are ultimately trying to make sure they can keep the robots ringing you up.

O’Rielly, apparently knowing his audience well, lamented “those who profit from predatory lawsuits”—presumably against debt collectors—and “gotcha regulation purportedly targeting scammers” (the TCPA) that’s actually ruining things for “the good guys.”

Last year, 78 percent of debt collectors belonging to ACA said they’d had calls blocked. The debt collectors argue that blocking them ultimately hurts consumers who risk falling further behind on debts and dragged to court if they fail to pay.

O’Rielly echoed this sentiment in his speech: “[C]onsumers generally don’t want to miss out on debt collection notices,” O’Rielly claimed. “They want to receive information that would help them prevent delinquency and default, having their utilities cut, or their credit scores plummet. But many businesses have stopped making these crucial calls because the risk is too great.”



Margot Saunders at the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit working on consumer issues for low-income individuals, told MarketWatch last year that debt collecting robocallers often end up harassing people multiple times per day, including people who don’t owe any money or who have already paid or who cannot pay.

“Debt collectors don’t want to be subject to any limits, and consumers need relief,” Saunders said. They “can send a letter. It’s not like calls are the only way to communicate with people.”","FCC Commissioner: 'Repeat After Me: ""Robocall"" Is Not a Bad Word'"

278,BUSINESS,"This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Warren Buffett’s regulatory 13F Form filed on 05/15/2019. Please visit our ""Tracking 10 Years Of Berkshire Hathaway's Investment Portfolio"" article series for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and our previous update for the moves in Q4 2018.

During Q4 2018, Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A, BRK.B) 13F stock portfolio value increased ~9%, from $183B to $199B. The top five positions account for ~64% of the portfolio: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Coca-Cola (KO), and American Express (AXP). There are 45 individual stock positions, many of which are minutely small compared to the overall size of the portfolio.

Warren Buffett’s writings (pdfs here) are a treasure trove of information and are a very good source for anyone starting out on individual investing.

Note: In Q1 2019, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased ~6.5M class B shares at ~$201 and 1258 class A shares for a total outlay of $1.7B. Book Value as of Q1 2019 was ~$150 per share. So, the repurchase happened at ~134% of Book Value. In July 2018, Berkshire had announced a plan to make their re-purchase criteria to be more flexible - instead of the 120% of Book Value criteria, Buffett and Munger had to agree that Berkshire was trading below intrinsic value. The Class B shares currently trade at ~$203.

Amazon.com (AMZN): AMZN is a 0.43% of the portfolio stake established this quarter at prices between $1500 and $1820, and the stock currently trades above that range at $1884.

Verizon Communications (VZ): The minutely small remainder stake in VZ was disposed this quarter.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and PNC Financial (PNC): These two positions established in Q3 2018 saw substantial increases over the last two quarters. The 3.02% JPM stake was established at prices between $104 and $119, and increased by ~40% last quarter at prices between $92 and $115. There was another ~20% stake increase this quarter at prices between $97 and $107. The stock currently trades at ~$111. The 0.53% PNC stake was established at prices between $134 and $146, and increased by just over one-third last quarter at prices between $110 and $140. The stock is now at ~$130. This quarter also saw a ~5% stake increase.

Delta Air Lines (DAL): DAL was a very small 0.19% position in Q3 2016. The stake saw a whopping ~850% increase in Q4 2016 at prices between $39 and $52. The stock currently trades at $55.30, and the stake is now at 1.84% of the portfolio. There was a ~20% increase in Q2 2018 at prices between $49 and $56, and that was followed with an ~8% increase this quarter at ~$49.50.

Note: Berkshire controls ~10% of DAL, and their overall cost basis is ~$44.

Red Hat Inc. (RHT): RHT is a 0.47% of the portfolio position established last quarter and increased by ~22% this quarter. Last October, IBM agreed to acquire Red Hat for $190 per share cash. The stock is now at ~$186.

Wells Fargo & Co.: WFC is Buffett’s third-largest stake at 9.93% of the 13F portfolio. In recent activity, around 9M shares were sold in Q2 2017 at around $53 per share to bring the ownership stake below the 10% threshold. The stock currently trades at $46.24. Berkshire’s cost basis is at ~$24.50. The last six quarters had seen marginal trimming, and that was followed with a ~4% selling this quarter.

Southwest Airlines (LUV): LUV is a 1.40% portfolio stake purchased in Q4 2016 at prices between $38.50 and $51, and increased by ~10% in the following quarter at prices between $49.50 and $59. Q2 2018 saw another ~20% stake increase at prices between $50 and $57. The stock is now at $52.24. There was minor trimming in the last three quarters.

Note: Berkshire owns ~9.5% of LUV, and their overall cost basis is ~$42.

Charter Communications (CHTR): CHTR is a ~1% of the portfolio position. It was established during the last three quarters of 2014 at prices between $118 and $170. In Q2 2015, the position was again increased by ~42% at prices between $168 and $193, and that was followed with another ~21% increase the following quarter at prices between $167 and $195. The stock currently trades at ~$380, compared to Berkshire’s cost basis of ~$178. The last six quarters had seen a combined ~25% selling at prices between $250 and $395, and that was followed with a ~20% reduction this quarter at prices between $285 and $366.

Phillips 66 (PSX): PSX is now a very small 0.26% of the portfolio stake. It is a long-term position. In recent activity, Q2 and Q3 2015 saw a huge position (~62M shares) built at prices between $70.50 and $84.50. In Q1 2018, Phillips 66 repurchased 35M shares from Berkshire at $93.725 per share. There was a ~24% selling in Q2 2018 at prices between $95 and $122, and that was followed with a ~56% reduction next quarter at prices between $109 and $123. Last quarter saw another ~23% selling at prices between $78.50 and $118, and that was followed with a ~50% reduction this quarter at prices between $86 and $99. The stock is now at $88.01.

Note: Berkshire avoided disclosing PSX stake build-up in the original Q2 2015 13F by making use of the “section 13(F) Confidential Treatment Requests”. An amendment filed on 9/4/2015 disclosed the activity. Berkshire controlled ~16% of PSX at the time.

Apple Inc.: AAPL is currently the largest 13F portfolio stake at ~22%, and Berkshire’s ownership is at ~5% of the business. It was established in Q1 2016 at prices between $93 and $110, and increased by ~55% the following quarter at prices between $90 and $112. Q4 2016 saw another ~275% increase at prices between $106 and $118, and that was followed with a stake doubling in January 2017 at prices between $116 and $122. There was another ~23% increase in Q4 2017 at prices between $154 and $176, and that was followed with a ~45% increase in Q1 2018 at prices between $155 and $182. Since then, the activity has been minor. The stock currently trades at ~$190.

Note: As of Q4 2018, Berkshire’s overall cost basis on Apple was ~$141 per share.

Bank of America: Berkshire established this large (top-three) ~12% of the portfolio position through the exercise of Bank of America warrants. The warrants had a strike price of $7.14, compared to the current price of $28.71. The cost to exercise was $5B, and it was funded using the $5B in 6% preferred stock they held. There was a ~30% stake increase in Q3 2018 at prices between $27.75 and $31.80 and a marginal increase last quarter.

Note: Berkshire’s ownership stake in Bank of America is ~9.5%, and their overall cost basis as of Q4 2018 is $12.68.

American Express and Coca-Cola: These two very large stakes were kept steady during the last ~5 years. Buffett has said these positions will be held “permanently”. Berkshire’s cost basis on AXP and KO are at around $8.49 and $3.25 respectively, and the ownership stakes are at ~17.6% and ~9.4% respectively.

Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC): KHC is currently a large position at 5.33% of the portfolio. Kraft Heinz started trading in July 2015, with Berkshire owning just over 325M shares (~27% of the business). The stake came about as a result of two transactions with 3G Capital as partner: a ~$4B net investment in 2013 for half of Heinz, and a ~$5B investment for the acquisition of Kraft Foods Group in early 2015. Berkshire’s cost basis on KHC is ~$30 per share, compared to the current price of $32.44.

US Bancorp (USB): The 3.12% USB stake has been in the portfolio since 2006. The original position was tripled during the 2007-2009 time frame. It was then kept relatively steady till Q2 2013, when ~17M shares were purchased at prices between $32 and $36. H1 2018 had seen a ~16% increase at prices between $49 and $58, and that was followed with a ~25% increase in Q3 2018 at prices between $50 and $55. The stock is now at $51.35, and Berkshire’s cost basis is ~$38. There was a ~4% stake increase last quarter.

Moody’s Inc. (MCO): MCO is a 2.24% of the 13F portfolio stake. It is a very long-term position, and Buffett’s cost basis is $10.05. The stock currently trades at ~$189. Berkshire controls ~13% of the business.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK): BK is a ~2% of the 13F portfolio stake. The bulk of the original position was purchased in Q2 2012 at prices between $19.50 and $25. In recent activity, 2017 saw a ~180% increase at prices between $43.50 and $55, while last year saw another one-third increase at prices between $44.50 and $58.50. The stock currently trades at $46.84. Berkshire’s cost basis on BK is ~$46 per share.

Goldman Sachs (GS): GS is a 1.77% of the portfolio stake established in Q4 2013. Berkshire received $5B worth of warrants to buy GS stock during the financial crisis (October 2008) at a strike price of $115 (43.5M shares) that was to expire on October 1, 2013. Buffett exercised the right before expiry to start this long position. In recent activity, Q3 2018 saw a ~40% stake increase at prices between $220 and $243. It currently trades at ~$199. Their overall cost basis is ~$127 per share.

General Motors (GM): GM is a 1.34% of the 13F portfolio position that was first purchased in Q1 2012 at prices between $21 and $30. By Q3 2017, the position size had increased by around six times (10M shares to 60M shares). Q4 2017 saw a reduction: ~17% selling at prices between $40.50 and $46.50. There was a ~38% stake increase last quarter at prices between $30.50 and $38.50. The stock currently trades at $37.35. Overall, Berkshire’s cost basis on GM is ~$32.

Verisign Inc. (VRSN): VRSN was first purchased in Q4 2012 at prices between $34 and $49.50. The position was more than doubled in Q1 2013 at prices between $38 and $48. The buying continued till Q2 2014 at prices up to $63. The stock currently trades at ~$198, and the position is at 1.18% of the portfolio (~10% of the business).

DaVita Inc. (DVA): DVA is a ~1% of the portfolio position that was aggressively built up over several quarters in the 2012-13 time frame at prices between $30 and $49. The stock currently trades at $50.29, compared to Berkshire’s overall cost basis of ~$45 per share.

Note: Berkshire’s ownership stake in DaVita is ~23%. In May 2013, Berkshire’s Ted Weschler signed an accord with DVA, limiting open market purchases to 25% of the company.

Liberty SiriusXM Group (LSXMA, LSXMK): The tracking stock was acquired as a result of Liberty Media’s recapitalization in April 2016. Shareholders received 1 share of Liberty SiriusXM Group, 0.25 shares of Liberty Media Group, and 0.1 shares of Liberty Braves Group for each share held. Berkshire held 30M shares of Liberty Media, for which he received the same amount of Liberty SiriusXM Group shares. There was a ~40% stake increase in Q2 2017 at a cost basis of ~$40 per share. The stock is now at $38.51.

Note: LSXMA/LSXMK is trading at a significant NAV discount to the parent’s (SIRI) valuation. For investors attempting to follow Buffett, LSXMA/LSXMK is a good option to consider for further research.

United Continental Holdings (UAL): A minutely small 0.18% UAL position as of Q3 2016 saw a huge ~540% increase in Q4 2016 at prices between $52.50 and $76. It currently goes for ~$82. The stake is at 0.88% of the portfolio. Last year had seen a ~22% selling at prices between $63 and $98.

Note: Berkshire controls ~8% of UAL, and their overall cost basis is ~$55.

USG Corporation (USG): USG was a very long-term holding, and there was a significant 21.39M share stake increase in Q4 2013 due to conversion of notes at $11.40 per share - Berkshire acquired the convertible notes during the financial crisis (2/2009), and USG opted to redeem them on 12/16/2013. Q2 2014 saw a ~12% stake increase at prices between $30 and $33. In March 2018, the USG board rejected a $42 per share cash offer by Germany’s Knauf. Partly in response, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing in April that they would vote against USG directors in the upcoming annual meeting. In June, USG accepted a $44 per share cash offer (includes 50c special dividend) from Knauf, and that transaction closed last month. Buffett controlled around 31% of the business, and his cost basis was ~$19.

American Airlines (AAL): AAL stake was first purchased in Q3 2016. The position is now at 0.70% of the portfolio.

The three quarters through Q1 2016 had also seen a combined ~30% increase at prices between $30 and $50. Q2 2016 saw a ~17% further increase at prices between $27 and $39. The stock is now at $25.03, and the stake is at 0.34% of the 13F portfolio.

279,BUSINESS,"Baidu's (NASDAQ: BIDU) stock is tumbling to a multiyear low after the Chinese tech giant posted its first-quarter earnings late on Thursday.

On the plus side, revenue rose 15% year-over-year to 24.1 billion RMB ($3.6 billion), matching expectations. Excluding the impact of its announced divestments, its revenue grew 21%.

However, Baidu saw red ink for the first time since its 2005 IPO, with a net loss of 327 million renminbi ($49 million), versus a profit of 6.7 billion RMB a year earlier. Its adjusted earnings -- which exclude divestments, acquisitions, and other charges -- plunged 80% to 967 million RMB ($144 million), or $0.41 per American Depository Share (ADS), missing estimates by $0.16.

For the second quarter, Baidu expects its revenue to stay roughly flat year over year on a reported basis, and rise just 1%-6% after excluding its upcoming divestments. That growth is shockingly weak compared to its double-digit sales growth over the past two years. Baidu's stock deserved to slide after that report, and things could get uglier before they get better.

Baidu's online marketing revenues rose 3% annually and accounted for 73% of its top line. That represented a massive slowdown from its growth in previous quarters.

Baidu stated that strong demand for ads in the education, retail, and business services markets failed to offset ""less vibrant"" demand from the healthcare, online gaming, and financial sectors. Baidu also stopped disclosing its growth in active online customers, and Hailong Xiang, the senior VP of its search unit, abruptly resigned.

Meanwhile, TAC (traffic acquisition costs) rose 41% annually and accounted for 13% of its total revenue and 18% of its marketing revenue. Those percentages were in line with previous quarters, and indicates that Baidu isn't spending too much money to lock in advertisers.

By comparison, Alphabet's Google spent 22% of its ad revenue on TAC last quarter, while Baidu's smaller rival, Sogou, spent a whopping 57% of its revenue on TAC last quarter.

However, Baidu's total operating expenses still surged 53% annually, and its non-GAAP operating margin plunged from 26% to 2%. That expense spike was caused by its ongoing investments in its virtual assistant DuerOS, its short video app Haokan, its autonomous driving platform Apollo, Mini Programs for the Baidu App, cloud services, and other ecosystem expansion efforts.

Are those investments paying off?

Baidu believes that those investments widen its moat against companies like Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY), and ByteDance.

Alibaba competes against Baidu in the virtual assistant and smart speaker market, and it also sells ads across its marketplaces and digital media platforms. During the first quarter, Baidu's installed base for DuerOS grew 279% annually to 275 million devices as monthly voice queries surged 817% to 2.37 billion. By comparison, Alibaba recently stated that 10 million of its Tmall Genie speakers had been activated since Aug. 2017.",Baidu Posts Its First Loss Since Its IPO -- and Things Could Get Worse
280,ENTERTAINMENT,"Game of Thrones' very last episode--Season 8, Episode 6--is coming to TV and computers everywhere on Sunday, May 19. HBO's official previews of the episode have revealed almost nothing--the Episode 6 teaser trailer and photos only include the sorts of things you would expect after watching Episode 5, which means there's plenty of speculation to go around. (Some fans are wondering if we'll see Young Griff, but that seems highly unlikely.) Characters like Arya, Tyrion, and Jon Snow appear shellshocked by everything that's happened, but throughout the second half of the episode, we never got a look at how Daenerys is feeling about things.

She made it out of Episode 5 with the victory she wanted, but her actions at King's Landing conflicted with her previous pronouncement that she didn't want to be ""queen of the ashes."" The move alienated many of Dany's allies, which raises the question: will the series' finale also be the end for the Mother of Dragons? We might already know how that will happen, as you can see below.

With Daenerys Targaryen gone full Mad Queen in Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 5, ""The Bells,"" the question on everybody's mind is simple: Who can possibly stop the Dragon Queen in the show's final episode ever?

Will Arya kill Dany, fulfilling the final part of Melisandre's ""brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes"" prediction? (Dany should have purple eyes, based on the books, but actress Emilia Clarke's eyes are, indeed, green.) Will Jon kill Dany for her crimes during the Fall of King's Landing, and assume his rightful role as king? Or will something more surprising happen--a twist, involving Varys and his little birds, that seems extremely likely in light of some quiet scenes early on in Episode 5?

Here's what everybody missed as we became absorbed in Varys's execution, Dany's massacre of the smallfolk, and Cleganebowl (the hype was real): Varys and his young spy, Martha, were actively trying to poison Dany before she cut his scheming short.

In the episode's opening scene, Varys was very clearly writing letters explaining Jon Snow's true identity, presumably to send to everyone with a pair of eyeballs in Westeros in order to justify Jon seizing the throne. Although he's still doing this later in the episode when Grey Worm comes for him, it's unclear whether he actually sent any ravens--if he did, it happened offscreen. My money's on yes, but that's beside the point, for now.

When one of Varys's ""little birds,"" Martha, enters the room, they have a brief exchange in which Martha tells Varys that ""she won't eat"" (""she"" presumably being Dany), and Varys replies that they'll ""try again at supper."" Martha believes Dany's soldiers are watching her, and Varys attempts to reassure the little girl by reminding her that big risks garner big rewards. At the end of the scene, Varys sends Martha back to the kitchen, where she apparently works.

“The greater the risk, the greater the reward.” What's a bigger risk than attempting to poison the Targaryen queen?

It's a very Varys-like move; the Master of Whispers is always plotting, and frankly, his arc this season has felt uncharacteristically dumb. His plan was to approach Jon and Tyrion directly, and if they didn't go for it, he'd just die? That's not the Spider we used to know. But openly defying the queen--a classic, if risky, misdirect--while he secretly plots to poison her from the shadows? Now that's more fitting.

That isn't all, though--there's one other scene that hints at the poison plot, and might even give us a clue to how Dany will go down in the finale.

When Varys hears Grey Worm and the Unsullied marching down the hall toward his room, he burns the letter he was writing--and removes his rings. The camera lingers in an extreme close-up as he twists one briefly, pulls it off, and drops it into an empty chalice on his desk. The rest soon follow.

This could be nothing, or it could be everything: When Olenna Tyrell poisoned Joffrey at his wedding, she plucked the poison--appropriately dubbed ""the strangler""--from Sansa's necklace, which had been given to her by the fool Dontos at Littlefinger's behest, and dropped the false crystal into Joffrey's cup, where it presumably dissolved and became undetectable.

Zooming in on Varys's rings and brightening up the image doesn't reveal any conspicuous blue crystals. In fact, the ring we get the best look at seems to have represented Varys's loyalty to the Targaryen queen--it appears to be this ring from jewelry retailer Mey's official partnership with the show. The retailer calls it an ""allegiance ring,"" and their site claims that Varys, Tyrion, Jorah, and Grey Worm have all worn one since Season 7. It was designed to look like a dragon spine. In taking it off, Varys is symbolically shedding the symbol of his loyalty to Daenerys.

But Varys is still loyal to Jon, who he now knows is also a Targaryen. Even though we didn't see the obvious blue poison crystal as Varys removed all his rings, the show seemed to focus on their removal just long enough that it might be important in the finale. That scullery maid, Martha, may still be skulking around, after all, and her master's death at Dany's hands could inspire her to continue attempting to carry out his final wish: To see the Dragon Queen dead, no matter the method.

Just in case, I'll be watching out for any sign of Martha in Game of Thrones' Season 8 finale.","Game Of Thrones Finale: Clue Could Mean Dany Dies In Episode 6, Season 8"
281,ENTERTAINMENT,"Eleven days after the arrival of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the royal tyke’s birth certificate has been released — and a mystery solved.

Brace yourselves: Baby Archie was born in a hospital.

A shocker, we know. Queen Elizabeth II's eighth great-grandchild did not arrive in a bathtub at Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Castle grounds, as tut-tutting royal correspondents had previously speculated.

Rather, Archie was born at Portland Hospital, an American-owned, upscale, private medical center in London's Westminster neighborhood on the morning of May 6.

The specific where and how surrounding the birth of the son of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, had been matter of great interest because:

1. Harry and Meghan, the palace warned, had made “a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.” So royal watchers kind of freaked out.

2. Meghan is a feminist, an American from California, and so it was rumored/reported in the British press that she wanted to have a home birth (audible tsk-tsking), with a helping hand from a midwife, not a bunch of “men in suits.” (Didn’t matter that most British mums have babies with midwives).

3. This broke recent protocol, set by Harry’s older brother Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who dutifully had their three heirs in the maternity wing at St. Mary’s Hospital in London — and then appeared a few hours later to pose before the global cameras with the newborns.

There was one other kind of cool thing about the birth certificate.

It lists the mother’s name as “Rachel Meghan Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.”

And then for occupation? “Princess of the United Kingdom.”

Royal baby: A boy, and a break from tradition, for Prince Harry and Meghan

Were Prince Harry and Meghan inspired by ‘Riverdale’ in naming their son Archie?

282,ENTERTAINMENT,"Any movie about Elton John would have to be much, much larger than life. Its spectacular subject has been a legend for decades, his songs ubiquitous, his stage presence iconic.

So when I say there are at least four movies knocking around in Rocketman, I don’t mean it as a slight. It’s a biopic and a jukebox musical and a romance, and also a movie about addiction, all crammed into a frenetic, jewel-studded ecstasy of a movie.

And you know what? For the most part, I think it works.

Rocketman is smart enough to not try to outshine its star. It’s flashy because Elton John is a light source all his own. It’s absolutely exploding with energy because Elton John is its pulse. It stumbles a few times — as has its subject — but on the whole, it’s a consistently good performance from start to finish, a movie rooted in a real story that nonetheless doesn’t keep itself too tethered to the ground.

Which is a bit of a relief. You don’t have to be a fan of Elton John’s music to know his music; even the most pop culture-oblivious person knows “Your Song,” and “Tiny Dancer,” and “Rocket Man.” And it’s easy, watching Taron Egerton play Elton John whipping a crowd into a frenzy, to understand his genius. It’s a solid introduction to the singer that is also guaranteed to please his fans.

And if the movie doesn’t reach his level, well, that’s fine. Can you really blame it?

Rocketman turns Elton John’s life into a musical, scored by himself

Rocketman has been a passion project for Dexter Fletcher, who was originally attached to direct an R-rated version of last year’s Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. That film was taken from him by 20th Century Fox and handed to Bryan Singer; when Singer was eventually fired from the project after going AWOL from the set, Fletcher was brought back on to finish and clean it up. (According to Fletcher, the film’s star, Rami Malek, told him that if Fletcher were to “come to set and shit on the floor, you’ll still do a better job than this guy.”)

Fletcher didn’t get a directorial credit on Bohemian Rhapsody, which turned out curiously bland for centering on such a flashy figure, but the movie was still a monster box office hit and nabbed nominations and wins throughout awards season.

Now it seems safe to say that Fletcher’s own time has come, and he’s made a movie that is, above all, aggressively not bland. It opens with Elton John (Egerton, who is excellent throughout), in a fiery orange, campy sequined devil suit with horns, striding through a hallway that looks like it might be backstage at a venue but turns out to be the hallway to an AA meeting. He plops himself into a chair, declares himself to be addicted to alcohol — and cocaine, and pills, and weed, and plenty of other things — and starts telling his life story to the slightly dumbfounded group.

That rock-bottom moment provides the film’s frame, which means this is more than just a paint-by-numbers saunter through the life of an icon. The screenplay by Lee Hall (Billy Elliot, War Horse) tells the tale of a deeply lonely, deeply insecure man with addiction who’s launched to fame early but has a lot of hurdles to clear before he can learn to be a human.

Those hurdles start when he’s a child in an unhappy home, raised by a bitter mother (Bryce Dallas Howard), an attentive grandmother (Gemma Jones), and an emotionally absent father (Steven Mackintosh). He shows promise early, studying at the Royal Academy of Music and eventually attracting the attention of budding manager Ray Williams (Charlie Rowe), who connects him with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell).

The two men form what turns out to be a lifelong partnership, Bernie writing the lyrics, Elton writing the music and performing. And soon, it’s as if someone’s lit a rocket under Elton; in the film’s rendering, a gig at the Troubadour in Los Angeles makes him into a superstar almost overnight, by his mid-20s.

It’s a wild ride, though the outlines are familiar: Unassuming boy from a small town hits it big, wins admirers, gets rich, finds love, loses love, alienates old friends, gets hooked on substances, crashes, and must overcome his own worst enemy: himself. Which is just what Rocketman does, particularly once his manager and lover John Reid (Richard Madden) enters the picture.

The film uses the rocker’s biggest hits as a trail of bread crumbs; although Taupin writes most of his lyrics, they’re still known as Elton John’s songs, and in Rocketman, they’re also the soundtrack to John’s own life, expressions of his longings and sadness and joy. It’s a jukebox musical about Elton John, using the music of Elton John, and the theatricality and personal nature of his songs work well for this purpose.

So even if the arc is somewhat predictable, it’s not a total wash. There’s a reason so many rocker biopics follow the same trajectory; it’s a mythology rooted in fact. We know, more or less, where this is going — the fun of Rocketman is how it gets there.

Rocketman tells a familiar story but in a mostly refreshing way

What Rocketman smartly does while telling a familiar arc is mess with some of the cinematic particulars to keep things from getting stale. (I saw the film at an 8 am screening, four weary days into the Cannes Film Festival, and I can say with certainty that it is never, ever boring.) The most successful technique Fletcher employs is letting the film stray away from too much realism; in the early Troubadour gig, for instance, when Elton starts playing “Crocodile Rock,” both he and the crowd begin to float up into the air. It’s a bit of fantasy that depicts the reality, the feeling of the music more than the literalism of it.

This happens throughout Rocketman, which employs everything from full-scale song-and-dance numbers on a carnival pier to cheeky montages seemingly mounted on a West End stage to the repeated appearance of Elton’s younger self. For the most part, it’s seamlessly woven into the narrative. We’re more inside Elton’s headspace than relying on Egerton to telegraph his emotions to us, as good as his performance is. (He can dance like a dervish and very competently does his own singing, if you were wondering.)

At times, though, Rocketman is less inventive than it should be — particularly at the end, when it employs the very tired but very common technique of showing us pictures of the movie’s characters next to real photos in order to, I don’t know, prove that they got it right? It’s unnecessary, a failure of imagination after hours of casting a magical spell over the audience. It suggests that the filmmaking team didn’t quite have the guts to go full throttle and lean into the spectacle that might have been possible.

Still, Rocketman knows its main job isn’t just to tell us about Elton John but to let us into his headspace, his struggles, and his lifelong search for love. And so it turns out the film is a romance — not between Elton and John Reid (though it does contain their much-touted, moderately explicit sex scene) but between Elton and Bernie, who is straight, loyal, and not afraid to plainly tell his friend that he loves him. The film spends less time dwelling on the machinations of celebrity and fame to focus on their story instead.

It’s a bit refreshing to see that kind of relationship portrayed with such openness and honesty, particularly in a friendship between two men that never slips into masculine buddy clichés. The composition of “Your Song,” with its familiar refrain of “how wonderful life is, now you’re in the world,” is collaborative for them precisely because it’s a song as well as a feeling that they share. And it’s Bernie’s steady love of his friend that is Elton’s anchor in the end. That’s what keeps Rocketman from becoming a tragedy.

So yes, Rocketman sometimes feels like it’s lost its way, especially near the end. But it’s still a joyous celebration, a colorful story about love that can help people heal. Filtered through Elton John’s beloved hits, it’s an outsize, audacious, jubilant take on a familiar story — and there’s no denying it’s shooting for the stars.

283,ENTERTAINMENT,"Grumpy Cat may be gone, but the memes that helped propel her to fame live on.

Grumpy Cat, whose real name was Tardar Sauce, died on Tuesday due to “complications from a recent urinary tract infection,” her owners shared in a statement posted to the feline’s official social media accounts on Friday. She was 7.

“Despite care from top professionals, as well as from her loving family, Grumpy encountered complications from a recent urinary tract infection that unfortunately became too tough for her to overcome,” the family's statement read.

HOW MUCH WAS THE GRUMPY CAT WORTH?

“Grumpy Cat has helped millions of people smile all around the world,” it continued.

Grumpy, who has 2.4 million followers on Instagram, inspired some of the most popular memes on social media after her permanent displeased expression was first shared on Reddit six years ago, per The New York Times.

The feline quickly went viral, spawning a countless number of memes. The cat’s popularity surged to such heights she was later named the Friskies’ official “spokescat,” per the newspaper, which also noted she later starred in a Lifetime Christmas movie called “Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever” and once graced the cover of New York Magazine.

While there have been discrepancies over how much the feline was reportedly worth. Estimates have ranged from $1 million to $100 million, though her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, later denied the latter amount in an interview with the Huffington Post.

Following the news of the cat’s death, many people took to social media to share some of the feline’s funniest moments.

286,ENTERTAINMENT,"Woodstock 50 has received financial backing from new investors. The festival celebrating the original 1969 event has faced multiple setbacks as of late, including exiting investors: initial backers Dentsu Aegis Network pulled financial support from the festival back in April, stating that Woodstock 50 had been outright canceled. Now, the festival organizers have announced American investment bank Oppenheimer & Co. have stepped in as the new financiers.

“We are thrilled to be onboard for this incredible weekend of music and social engagement,” said John Tonelli, head of Debt Capital Markets & Syndication at Oppenheimer, in a press release. “We believe in Woodstock as an important American cultural icon and look forward to its regeneration in the green fields of Watkins Glen this August with all of the artists on the remarkable lineup.”

Prior to losing investors, Woodstock 50’s organizers failed to acquire a mass gathering permit from the New York State Department of Health (DOH), and ticket sales for the event were subsequently delayed. In early May, promoter Michael Lang—an original partner in the inaugural 1969 festival—insisted that the event was still taking place. It’s yet to be confirmed whether Woodstock 50 has received a mass gathering permit from NYS DOH.

There is drama behind the scenes of Fox’s upcoming “Beverly Hills 90210” revival that is worthy of — well, “Beverly Hills, 90210.”

Showrunner Patrick Sean Smith and several senior writers have quit the six-episode series, which is titled “BH90210.” The exact reason for the exodus is unclear. One source said the dispute was over interference from two of the show’s lead actresses, while another noted that the writers were unhappy with one of the executives overseeing the project.

Paul Sciarrotta has been named the new showrunner along with series creators Chris Alberghini and Mike Chessler. Sciarrotta, a member of the show’s writing staff, is under an overall deal with CBS Television Studios, which is producing the series.

“BH90210” is set to debut on Fox on Aug. 7. Original series cast members Jason Priestley, Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Gabrielle Carteris, Brian Austin Green and Tori Spelling will all return. In the series, the actors will not be playing their characters from the show, but rather heightened versions of themselves. Having gone their separate ways since the original series ended 19 years ago, Jason, Jennie, Ian, Gabrielle, Brian and Tori reunite when one of them suggests it’s time to get a “Beverly Hills, 90210” reboot up and running.

There has been significant interest in the new series, with the initial teaser trailer amassing 18.4 million views across various platforms.

“BH90210” will be produced by CBS Television Studios and Fox Entertainment. Sciarrotta, Alberghini and Chessler will executive produce along with Carteris, Garth, Green, Priestley, Spelling, Doherty and Ziering.

Beverly Hills, 90210” premiered on Fox in 1990 and went on to become one of the top shows on the network. It aired for 10 seasons and spawned multiple series set in the same universe, including The CW’s “90210” and Fox’s “Melrose Place.”","Behind-the-scenes drama at ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’ revival"

The 24-year-old singer shared a single and music video Thursday for ""Nightmare,"" her first solo song in seven months.

The video features all women, including Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Debbie Harry. It shows Halsey performing for an energetic crowd as she sings about the frustrations of being female in 2019.

""I've been polite but won't be caught dead letting a man tell me what I should do with my bed,"" Halsey quoted the song on Twitter.

""'IM TIRED AND ANGRY, BUT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE,'"" she added.

Halsey said ""Nightmare"" was inspired by her female fans.

""imagine getting onstage every night and seeing young women sweating mascara tears, lightning in their eyes, throwing elbows and raising fists, screaming till the veins in their necks raise under warm skin, and not being inspired by it,"" she wrote. ""this song is about you, for you.""

""Nightmare"" is expected to appear on Halsey's forthcoming third studio album. The singer released Hopeless Fountain Kingdom in June 2017 and has since released the singles ""Without Me"" and ""11 Minutes.""",Halsey releases new single 'Nightmare'
292,ENTERTAINMENT,"The show's longest-tenured correspondent is known for his incisive interviews and impactful investigations. But he admits, ""I'm not easy.""

Steve Kroft, the longest-tenured 60 Minutes correspondent, will retire at the end of his 30th season on the iconic newsmagazine. His last piece — about what could be the biggest money laundering scheme ever — will air Sunday on the show’s 51st season finale. Kroft, 73, will announce his plan to step down at the conclusion of the broadcast. In September, 60 Minutes will air a retrospective of Kroft’s 50-year career in journalism.

Kroft's exit comes in the wake of a difficult period for CBS News and 60 Minutes. The show and the news division overall were under intense scrutiny for nearly two years following the ouster of Charlie Rose in November 2017, amid widespread misconduct claims, and culminating last September with the exit of longtime executive producer Jeff Fager. But the ascension of Susan Zirinsky to president of the division and the February appointment of 60 Minutes executive Bill Owens to succeed Fager lifted a cloud of anxiety. Kroft's decision to leave the show now, at the relatively tender age of 73, is notable for a show known for the longevity of its correspondent corps. Mike Wallace was nearly 90 when he filed his last piece, a 2008 interview with Roger Clemens. Morley Safer was 84 when he retired in 2016. Lesley Stahl, 77, who joined 60 Minutes in 1991, now becomes the show's longest-serving correspondent. But Kroft also has slowed down in recent years, filing approximately eight to ten pieces a season for the past two seasons. And those who know him say he has been talking about retiring for some time.

Kroft has filed nearly 500 pieces for 60 Minutes, including stories that are among the broadcast's most indelible interviews. His 1992 sit-down with Bill and Hillary Clinton — which aired after the Super Bowl and was watched by 34 million people — was remarkable for its wincing candor. Bill Clinton was fighting to save his candidacy after a supermarket tabloid revealed his 12-year affair with Gennifer Flowers. And he was visibly peeved when Kroft asked if the Clintons' marriage was “an arrangement.” Then, of course, Hillary Clinton infamously invoked Tammy Wynette. And then a light fixture came crashing down on the Clintons, causing them to jump off the sofa.

“It was by far the biggest interview I’d ever done and I remember being nervous,” Kroft tells The Hollywood Reporter.

At that point, he had been at the broadcast for fewer than three years.

“It began awkwardly because of the delicate subject matter, but as Hillary got more involved and joined in the conversation, I knew we had a good story. When she made the Tammy Wynette remark, I knew we were home free,” he said.

He landed the only interview with Woody Allen during his acrimonious custody battle with Mia Farrow. His 1997 interview with Clint Eastwood was notable for its probing questions about Eastwood’s role as a father; he had seven children with five women. Was this not “somewhat unconventional?” asked Kroft. Eastwood fixed him with a stony glare.

“I kept thinking how long is this silence going to last and what do I do about it and how do I get out of here?” he said. “The thought crossed my mind that he might walk out. Clint has gotten a lot of mileage out of that look over the years. It’s very effective.”

He conducted 16 interviews with Barack Obama, including days after the 2011 assassination of Osama bin Laden. And his jailhouse interview with former nurse Charles Cullen — who authorities believe killed hundreds of people — was the only time a serial killer appeared on 60 Minutes.

But Kroft’s biggest contribution to the show — and journalism — have been his investigations. Kroft and his producers uncovered Saddam Hussein’s hidden financial assets, estimated in the billions of dollars; the report attracted worldwide attention. A 2011 story on insider trading in the U.S. Congress drove the passage of Senate and House versions of the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge). He exposed Greg Mortenson’s fabrications in the author’s best-selling book, Three Cups of Tea. A 2006 report uncovered the stunning theft of $500 million by Iraqis the U.S. entrusted to re-equip the country’s army.

But he says the story that had the most impact on him was an October 2001 report about financial firm Sandler O’Neill, which lost 70 people — a third of its employees — in the World Trade Center attacks.

“In the days following the disaster, the surviving partner, Jimmy Dunne, allowed us to follow him and other managers as they planned the funerals, comforted and counseled the families, and against impossible odds, kept the company running during the worst days,” he said. “It survived and is thriving today.”

Kroft was born in Kokomo, Indiana, and grew up there and in Chappaqua, New York. He attended Syracuse University, where he volunteered at the school’s radio station and newspaper. He graduated in 1967, just in time to be drafted into Vietnam. He served one tour, working as a correspondent and photographer for Stars and Stripes and the Armed Forces Network. He wasn't afraid to go to Vietnam, “but I can’t say I was looking forward to it,"" he said. ""I only had two other choices: go to Canada or go to jail.”

After returning stateside, he landed a job at a Syracuse station and then did stints at local stations in Florida. He joined CBS News in 1980, and was named national correspondent the following year. He landed a job at 60 Minutes in 1989. Wallace — known for his doggedness and tenacity — is said to have called Kroft his replacement after seeing the young anchor on the CBS Evening News.

Kroft excelled at “bounce stories,” deeper dives on the big stories of the moment. But his pieces were also notable for their elegant writing and compelling, and often unexpected, narratives. He is also a perfectionist, which could at times make him a difficult collaborator. Asked how his producers would describe him, Kroft said: “I think if you asked them during the scripting process the answer would be unprintable. When the story is finished and screened, they would be more complimentary. I’m not easy.”",Steve Kroft to Retire from '60 Minutes' (Exclusive)

294,ENTERTAINMENT,"Nipsey Hussle’s final music video was released Friday, nearly two months after he was shot dead in front of his Los Angeles clothing store.

DJ Khaled’s “Higher” is one of 15 tracks on his latest album, “Father of Asahd,” and features both John Legend and Hussle, whose birth name was Ermias Asghedom.

Opening with a tribute to Grammy-nominated Hussle, the video shows the late rapper in an electric blue ensemble and black loafers as he stands alongside Khaled, joined by Legend on piano and vocals.

In a tweet two days before the video was unveiled, Khaled said it was recorded just days before Hussle’s death.

“Recently, I embarked on a soul-searching journey down a road I never thought I would travel in a million years,” he wrote. “It began when a tragedy robbed the world of an enlightened soul, a brother, a father, a partner and my friend Nipsey Hussle.”

“Just days prior, he shared his energy and positivity with me on a video set for a song called, ‘Higher,’” he continued. “After much prayer and reflection; and with the full blessing of the Asghedom family, I am sharing that moment with you.”

Khaled added that the song’s title is a reminder “that vibrating on a ‘Higher’ level was the essence of Nipsey’s soul.”

The artist noted that 100% of the proceeds from the track will be donated to Hussle’s children, Emani and Kross.

Roberts, who recently starred in the Amazon series “Homecoming,” revealed this — and much more — during an intimate conversation with Patricia Arquette for “Variety Studio: Actors on Actors.”

Before the interview began, Arquette collected submissions from her Twitter followers about what they would say to Roberts if they could ask her anything. Arquette then read a few of those entries on-camera. “One of the questions that people have for you was who’s going to sit on the throne at the end of ‘Game of Thrones?'” Arquette quizzed. “Do you watch ‘Game of Thrones’?”

“I’m going to say Barack Obama for $500!” Roberts joked. “I’ve never watched ‘Game of Thrones.’ But someone just told me a couple days ago, ‘You look like one of the wildings.'”

Johnny Galecki, who played Leonard Hofstadter on all 12 seasons of the hit CBS sitcom revealed that he was the only one to have sex in his dressing room. He was joined by the rest of the cast for a retrospective on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” after the highly anticipated finale aired. The host asked the cast questions that they anonymously submitted to one another when Galecki dropped the bombshell.

Simon Helberg, better known as Howard Wolowitz, noted that he believed Galecki had done the deed in his backstage room. The 44-year-old former “Roseanne” star sheepishly raised his hand confirming that he was the only one that had.

“That did not include me,” his co-star and ex-girlfriend Kaley Cuoco, 33, quickly clarified.

The long-running series on CBS concluded with two back-to-back episodes, ""The Change Constant"" and ""The Stockholm Syndrome,"" in an hourlong finale Thursday evening. The series exited the airwaves with the most episodes for a multicamera series ever with 279 episodes. It edged past NBC's ""Cheers,"" which aired for 12 seasons and 275 episodes.

Helberg jokingly took shots at “Cheers” throughout the interview noting that he was pleased to beat the classic sitcom’s run.

Colbert also asked Galecki about being a self-described “theater rat” and wondered what animal he’d describe Cuoco as.

“I’m sitting too close. I’m going to get punched,” Galecki responded before deciding that she’d be “an Arabian pretty horse.”

Massaro, 39, was discovered unconscious Thursday morning at her Smithtown home after she failed to show up to her job at a local radio station, The Blast reported.

She died en route to the hospital as emergency crews performed life-resuscitating measures on her to no avail, according to the report.

Friends said the former Playboy cover girl struggled with depression.

“My best friend from the wrestling business died from suicide two days after responding to 300+ fan letters,” pal Shelly Martinez said in a statement to The Blast. “She was the happiest I have seen her in years, so stoked that people still cared about her 11 years after her career was over. There are no signs. It comes without warning.”

The one-time “Survivor” contestant had been open about her mental health — and previously blamed bouts of depression on injuries suffered during her wrestling career.

Massaro joined a class-action lawsuit against the WWE, which alleged the organization failed to protect wrestlers from head trauma and concussions, according to The Blast.

She claimed in a 2017 affidavit that she suffered multiple concussions and was never warned about the risks associated.

“Aside from my on-going physical injuries that were sustained in the ring, and my former battle with addiction, to this day I suffer from depression, for which I take medication; migraine headaches; and severe short-term memory loss,” Massaro said in the affidavit.

Massaro — who would’ve turned 40 later this month — was the first winner of the WWE Diva Search before retiring from the company in 2008.

“We are saddened to learn of the tragic death of former WWE Superstar Ashley Massaro,” the company said. “She performed in WWE from 2005-2008 and was beloved by her fellow Superstars and fans around the world.

299,ENTERTAINMENT,"On May 6, in the afterglow of the Met Gala, YouTube beauty guru James Charles typed out a wish on Instagram. Charles, a hugely successful vlogger who can’t even drink legally yet, wished to be the lightning rod for “influencer representation in the media” — or, in other words, to be more famous, in the traditional platforms of fame, than he already is.

Four days later, fellow beauty YouTuber Tati Westbrook granted that wish, but likely not in the way Charles envisioned.

Charles is a 19-year-old vlogging sensation whose subscriber base runs more than 13 million deep. He lives in a strange pocket of fame where he’s relatively unknown to people over the age of 30 but an inescapable peacock of a person to anyone born after 1995. He first found popularity through Instagram, attaining viral success by wearing makeup in a yearbook photo. From there, he blew up on social media and elsewhere, as CoverGirl named him the company’s first male ambassador.

Charles quickly parlayed that into a successful YouTube channel, where he creates makeup looks and vlogs about his personal life for his fans (whom he calls “sisters”). He’s since launched his own merchandise and his own eyeshadow palettes, and now even has his own national tour. His videos, like “FaceTune Battle” and “Why I’m Going to Be Single Forever” regularly rake in more than 5 million views, with some videos reaching 20 million hits. Now he also “sings.” (That’s a generous way of putting it, in our opinion.)

Meanwhile, Westbrook, 37, courts a similar, if smaller, audience. She’s run the GlamLifeGuru channel since 2010, accruing north of 6 million followers with her makeup tips and skin care advice. And though her image and videos skew simple and positive, her beauty-loving viewers are devoted enough to protect their beauty idol at all costs — and powerful enough to deal major damage to Charles overnight.

So when Westbrook uploaded an emotional 43-minute video on May 10 that outlined times when her “close friend” Charles betrayed her trust, the fallout was immediate. It wasn’t just about the interpersonal drama, however — Westbrook stoked even bigger flames by digging into what she claimed was Charles’s predatory behavior toward other men.

“If I didn’t make this video, and I didn’t say things publicly, I think I would be feeling worse, “ she said. “You don’t get to the success that James Charles has without knowing how to work someone, and I don’t want to be worked.”

Since Westbrook released the video, Charles has bled more than 3 million subscribers from his channel and become the villain of the YouTube community. Celebrities and cosmetic brands have symbolically stopped following him in solidarity with Westbrook, and some of his closest friends have publicly dropped him. And more and more men have come out to add to Westbrook’s claims about Charles’s tendency to slide into their DMs, unwanted and unprompted.

This clash has all the makings of a traditional feud and the tale of a friendship gone sour, and that’s part of the attraction. Watching Charles’s follower count drop in real time is like watching a train wreck — it’s hard to look away from this explosive self-ruination, even if you have no ties to YouTube’s beauty community.

But the Charles-Westbrook feud is also as good a look as any into the lucrative ways YouTube works. The platform may reward authenticity and encourage gurus like Charles to open up about their personal lives as well as their work. Yet the YouTube audience can just as easily flip the script and turn on their favorite personality — and decimate not just their public image but their entire livelihood.

The feud between Tati Westbrook and James Charles was over business. Or so we thought.

To understand what prompted Westbrook to call out Charles, and how it damaged Charles to the extent that it has, is to understand the workings of the YouTube beauty vlogger community. Westbrook is the rare YouTube beauty guru who does not take sponsorship money from brands to promote their products on her videos. Though she receives products to review from cosmetic brands’ public relations departments, she has been very adamant about not receiving compensation from them, even including screenshots of email correspondence from brands to prove it. This has been true since she started vlogging in 2011, and has helped account for her popularity and establish her as a trustworthy figure.

Aside from YouTube ad revenue — Westbrook’s videos average around a million views — her income is drawn from her own company, Halo Beauty, a beauty vitamin/supplement brand she launched in 2018. That doctors say beauty supplements aren’t regulated and that there’s no scientific evidence suggesting they actually deliver on their multiple claims is a different article. What’s important here is that Westbrook owns and runs Halo Beauty, and it’s also the only brand she promotes, endorses, and fully stands by.

James Charles, Westbrook’s longtime friend, used to be on the same page. But at this year’s Coachella music festival, which kicked off April 19, Charles dealt her a devastating blow: He filmed an Instagram ad for SugarBear Hair beauty vitamins, a rival to Halo Beauty.

That’s a major diss in the world of sponsored content, especially to one’s friend, and Westbrook noticed. On April 22, she posted multiple, time-limited Instagram stories about feeling let down by an unspecified friend. But it wasn’t difficult for fans following her and Charles to know who she was talking about. (There was precedent here: Westbrook filmed a video in April 2018 about feeling betrayed by another friend and guru, Manny MUA, who had also promoted SugarBear.)

After speculation, some sleuthing fans deduced that Charles was the culprit. It prompted Charles to apologize.

“This weekend, I did an Instagram story for sleep vitamins that I’ve been taking because the brand helped me with security when the crowd around me at Coachella became unsafe,” Charles said in a public apology following Westbrook’s Instagram stories. “I did not accept any money from this post,” he added.

Westbrook didn’t respond immediately. But, goaded by Charles’s actions and a few Snapchat videos from an orbiting YouTuber named Gabriel Zamora who also had beef with Charles, she then uploaded that now-infamous YouTube video on May 10 and accused Charles of sending out a phony apology attempting to save his image.

“It’s embarrassing, and you know that because of things I’ve had to deal with in the past,” she said in her Charles-centric response video. “You sold me out, you threw away our friendship, you lied to me, made up a story, knew this would be embarrassing … I know you’re easily bought.”

Westbrook cited her two-year friendship with Charles, dating back to 2017, and how much she helped his career, to establish Charles’s actions as underhanded. When Charles and Westbrook met, she was already a well-known name in the beauty YouTuber community, while Charles was a 17-year-old fresh on the scene. Westbrook invited Charles to appear in some of her videos, including one where he did her wedding makeup, and in promoting him through her YouTube channel, she helped build his brand. (Westbrook said her husband even offered Charles financial advice.) Westbrook has also appeared in Charles’s videos, as recently as three months ago.

Most importantly, Westbrook maintained that she never did this for the promise of any money. Beauty vloggers and fans are precious about the nature of business relationships on YouTube and elsewhere, as well as ensuring that the people they’re attached to are honest — that they’re not just hanging out because they want to ride each other’s success, but because they are truly friends. So Westbrook’s claims that Charles betrayed her trust were enough to cause a retaliatory stir.

In an attempt at damage control, Charles uploaded an apology video directed at Westbrook.

Though his response has been viewed more than 41 million times, it’s received more than 2.7 million downvotes (compared to around 579,000 upvotes) — likely not the kind of ratio he wanted. Meanwhile, Tati’s channel has bloomed to more than 10 million subscribers, up over 4 million from when she first posted the video.

Tati Westbrook made it about more than money. She blew open a discussion about Charles’s alleged predatory behavior.

Westbrook called Charles’s choice to film a SugarBear ad just the latest in a string of crass, even manipulative behavior. She claimed Charles has a tendency to boast about approaching straight men and then “cracking” their sexuality.

“You’re doing that to have them behave sexually in your favor — even if they’re straight — and you know what, that’s not okay,” she said. “How dare you take that and laugh about it and make meme after meme [jokes like this one] about it.”

While Westbrook doesn’t name names or mention specific instances, it seems she might be referring to Charles’s interactions with a model named Gage Gomez. Charles and Gomez were seen together at the same Coachella where Charles filmed the now-infamous SugarBear ad.

Shortly after they were seen together at the festival, Charles tweeted — without naming Gomez — that a boy he was seeing had essentially conned perks out of him.

“Nope unfortunately i am still very single. this boy played me for months on end and is a disgusting con artist. I’m thankful I had my friends with me to protect me,” Charles tweeted (he has since deleted the tweet.)

After some back-and-forth on social media, in which Gomez indirectly talked about Charles being sexually aggressive toward him, Gomez posted a YouTube video detailing his relationship with Charles. He said that when they met, Charles pursued him despite Gomez insisting that he was straight — and even after Gomez repeatedly rejected Charles’s advances.

“He continued to [insist] that he didn’t know or that he forgot that I told him that I was straight in the beginning,” Gomez said. “I thought it [Coachella] was going to be a good time … there were some points where I guess he was not sure how I was feeling, even though I was telling him the whole time I wasn’t into, I guess you could say, ‘experimenting.’”

The situation Gomez describes doesn’t seem to be unique. In the wake of Westbrook’s video, other men said they’d had similar experiences with Charles making advances on them over Instagram DMs or other social media.

The highest-profile of these statements comes from Jeffree Star, another huge YouTube star turned brand maven whose career and fame long predates Charles’s. In a now-deleted tweet, Star — who is friends with Westbrook and was thought to be friends with Charles — said Charles’s behavior is why he and his boyfriend do not allow Charles in their home.

“There is a reason that Nathan [Star’s boyfriend] has banned James Charles from ever coming over to our home again,” he tweeted. “He is a danger to society. Everything Tati [Westbrook] said is 100% true.”

The accusations against Charles occupy an area of misconduct that our culture doesn’t really have a good grasp on. Charles is accused of using his fame to intimidate and make unwanted passes at men online, which is deplorable but may not be legally punishable. But the inflamed response suggests that Charles has been tried in the court of public opinion — and lost.

Charles has shed 3 million subscribers since Westbrook’s video, some unfollowing because of his perversion of YouTube branded content code — be good to your friends, not your wallet — and others turning against him because of his alleged misbehavior.

But that number might not include the bigger names that no longer wish to associate themselves with the contentious YouTuber. As redditors have pointed out (there’s a meticulously live-updated thread of the latest Twitter and Instagram unfollows), brands like Sephora, Smashbox, Ulta, and Fenty Beauty, and celebrities like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner, and Shawn Mendes have unfollowed Charles on social media in the wake of Westbrook’s video. Losing these celebrity followers shows those celebrities’ fans that they don’t support James; same with brands and clients.

Former fans on social media are taking it even further, destroying their James Charles merchandise and eyeshadow palettes. Charles is now the prominent example of “influencer representation in the media,” but for negative reasons.

He has been a lightning rod for scandal before; in 2017, for example, when he tweeted a racist joke about catching Ebola from Africans while on a flight to Africa, which was met with rightful backlash:

And again late last month, when he announced a nationwide live tour where he will conduct meet-and-greets and “sing”; tickets were going as high as $500, but after backlash and ridicule over the actual value of the event, Charles eventually lowered the VIP ticket prices to $250.

For the most part, though, Charles’s largely teenage fan base has defended their idol. And that’s led to controversy too. In November, for example, Charles launched his first eyeshadow palette and responded defensively to negative reviews. Fans rushed to back him up, lashing out at his critics online through social media messages and comments.

Some of Charles’s fans are standing by him even now, leaving comments on Westbrook’s Instagram and calling her a bully for hating on their favorite YouTuber:

Charles’s young career has been marked with a pattern of offense and apology, each time with the promise to be better. But it’s been a long two years of controversy. The dramatic distance that other celebrities, and the people who throw money at Charles, are putting between themselves and him indicates that Charles may have crossed a line he can’t uncross.

Becoming an influencer means turning yourself into a brand. James Charles is finding that out the hard way.

What lies at the heart of Charles’s scandals is that he doesn’t view himself as a business beyond, of course, being the shill. His more minor controversies, like the Ebola “joke” and tour prices, already showed a myopic view of how his behavior reflects his brand. But his inability to separate his personal issues and opinions from his business dealings may be because the line is nonexistent.

And that’s due to how YouTubers become famous.

Back in the day, fashion and beauty magazines like Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Allure, Glamour, and Cosmopolitan used to teach the public what was in fashion, what was good to put on our faces, and what we needed to buy to look great. But after the 2008 financial collapse left its mark on consumers as well as advertisers, the growth in democratized platforms like YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram rapidly began to disrupt the beauty industry.

Consumers no longer need a magazine to tell them what to purchase, what’s good and what’s skippable. Conversely, no one has to be printed in a magazine to be considered an authority. Beauty gurus — or influencers, as they’ve come to be known — deliver a promise: that they’ll give honest opinions on products, that they won’t be swayed by advertiser dollars (though this has changed over time), and that they’re more like you and me and all the other people watching than some high-paid beauty editor in a glass tower.

But the sell doesn’t stop at beauty products: Beauty gurus themselves have become products.

BeauTubers’ authority is born out of a perception of authenticity, and many gurus underline this authenticity by opening up about their personal lives onscreen. They reveal their darkest secrets, talk about their miscarriages, or detail their plastic surgery. They continually reassure their subscribers that they wouldn’t have gotten this far without them. They ask their subscribers to pick their makeup looks. Some even ask their followers to appear on their channels.

The thought is that since they’re sharing all parts of their lives and ostensibly being completely honest, beauty gurus are being honest about products they endorse or use. Because just like the Kardashians, some of the most powerful influencers in the world, beauty gurus want to sell you intimacy and friendship. It’s in their best interest to be earnest in their vulnerability.

Charles, with his 16 million subscribers (before Westbrook’s video), hit a point where he became more than a guru — hence the “tour” and the overpriced meet-and-greets. His fans adore him as a personality beyond the makeup looks he creates (though they like those too). But the Westbrook feud suggests he lost sight of that.

YouTube’s equation is that subscribing and upvoting becomes an important way to show loyalty and support to a YouTuber, built up by approval of their perceived honesty. Subscribing to a channel is also a tangible way for a vlogger to prove their worth — it’s akin to a valuation, and often comes with the ad revenue to match.

The flip side of that, then, is unsubscribing. In Charles’s case, the mass subscriber exodus was a forceful demonstration against him. Former fans were taking a stand to tell Charles that he was no longer the trustworthy, admirable idol they once thought he was; he was no longer a face they wanted to spend time watching or put money toward. As the numbers fell, so did Charles’s vlogger stock.

And that’s exactly why Westbrook’s video damaged him so much: It was an account from someone who knows him on a personal level, who claimed Charles has a dark side that fans didn’t know existed beneath the jokes and memes. Suddenly, the “friend” they knew, that Tati knew, wasn’t who they thought he was, because he was exposed by his actual, real-life friend (who also appears on his videos). Westbrook called out Charles as someone she couldn’t trust — and 3 million others followed suit.","James Charles, Tati Westbrook, and the feud that’s ripping apart YouTube’s beauty community"
300,ENTERTAINMENT,"Twilight and Harry Potter actor Robert Pattinson could be the next Batman. Variety reports that Pattinson will play the Caped Crusader in the new standalone film, The Batman, which is releasing in June 2021. The film is directed by Matt Reeves, who made the latest Planet of the Apes movies.

Deadline, however, reports that the deal isn't done yet. X-Men actor Nicholas Hoult is also reportedly a top choice to play Batman in the film. According to Deadline, Warner Bros. likes both actors, but Pattinson is the No. 1 choice at this stage.

The Hollywood Reporter also weighed in. Their sources said Armie Hammer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were also considered for the role of Batman in the movie.

Pattinson or Hoult will take over as Batman from Ben Affleck, who played the character in Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. At 29, Hoult could be the youngest-ever actor to be cast as Batman. Christian Bale played Batman for the first time at the age of 31 in Batman Begins, though it's not clear how old he was when he was cast. Other actors to have donned the cowl include Christian Bale, George Clooney, Val Kilmer, and Michael Keaton, among others.

""Warner Bros., in giving Reeves plenty of time to develop the script, is hoping the latest iteration of the DC icon is done right, following the disappointments of Batman v Superman and Justice League,"" according to Variety.

Sources told Variety that filming might begin on The Batman later this year or early 2020.

The Batman would be Pattinson's latest project with Warner Bros. He's also set to appear in Christopher Nolan's untitled ""event movie"" that's coming out in July 2020.

Affleck--who won Oscars for Good Will Hunting and Argo--was initially attached to write, direct, and star in a new Batman movie called The Batman. However, he eventually dropped out. Explaining his decision to leave, Affleck told Jimmy Kimmel that he ""couldn't crack it.""",Next Batman: Robert Pattinson And Nicholas Hoult Are Frontrunners; Other Actors Considered
301,ENTERTAINMENT,"There’s one joke that I can never resist telling. If I’m eating out and crêpes are on the menu, I will always say, “People say they’re crêpes, but I think they’re actually quite good.” The response varies according to how long a fellow diner has known me. New acquaintances fake a chuckle, old friends groan, and really old friends memorize the menus of local eating establishments so they can steer us away from places that serve French pancakes.

Long-running TV sitcoms face the same dilemma as my friend group, if on a slightly larger scale. If a situation has generated comedy for multiple seasons—12, say—does that mean millions of people have been laughing at the same “joke” for more than a decade? When a show has enjoyed the success of The Big Bang Theory—which continued to attract massive audiences throughout its run, even as overall TV viewership has declined—the answer is clearly yes.

I’m sure I wasn’t the only person who tuned in to the show I’d abandoned a few seasons back for the two-part series finale on Thursday night. It was like returning to the Mark Trail newspaper comic strip—even having missed approximately 75 episodes, it took no effort to figure out what had happened since I had last visited that Pasadena apartment building: not much.

In the opening scene, everyone and everything looked the same: The hoodies, superhero T-shirts worn over another T-shirt, and bulky sweater vests were still in rotation; the apartment décor hadn’t been updated or the furniture rearranged. Since the show premiered in September 2007, physicist roommates Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) have each found love—marriage even—with neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco) and neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), respectively, but the interpersonal dynamics haven’t undergone much of a makeover. Sheldon is still a self-centered egomaniac, Leonard is still exasperated by Sheldon, and Penny still doesn’t understand why her husband puts up with his former roommate. Nor does Amy, even though she is mad about the selfish oaf.

Nevertheless, the theme of The Big Bang Theory’s 278th episode was change. The gang might have been dressed, located, and arranged as they had always been, but instead of waiting for takeout, Sheldon and Amy were now anticipating a call from Sweden, which came in the first few minutes. This is almost certainly the first time two leading characters on a CBS sitcom have won the Nobel Prize in physics.

Then suddenly 12 years of carefully accumulated character traits unraveled. Sheldon’s self-confidence disappeared (at least temporarily). Despite many episodes in which friends Penny and Bernadette had gently tried to update her wardrobe, Amy suddenly realized that she looked “frumpy” and underwent a total transformation in the hands of TV’s most metrosexual sweater vest–wearer, Rajesh Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). And in the finale’s second half, Penny, who had always insisted she didn’t want children, was apparently excited to find herself pregnant.

One thing remained constant, however: Sheldon’s inability to consider other people’s feelings. As the Nobel ceremony neared, the friend group started to splinter. With kids back home in Los Angeles (Howard and Bernadette) or currently gestating (Penny and Leonard), the gang’s patience for tolerating the tantrums of a petulant man-child was evaporating.

It will surely come as no surprise to learn that the friendpocalypse was averted. Over the course of nearly 300 weeks, Raj learned to talk to women, Howard stopped letching, Penny found a career she was good at, Leonard somehow managed not to kill Sheldon, and in the very final episode Sheldon got in touch with his emotions. I’m not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an “I love you.”",The Big Bang Theory Ended With a Whimper
302,ENTERTAINMENT,"Herman Wouk, 'The Jackie Robinson Of Jewish-American Fiction,' Dies At 103

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Herman Wouk has died. Wouk was famous for his sprawling World War II novels, including The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, and for his portrayal of Jewish Americans in the novel Marjorie Morningstar. He died in his sleep Friday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif., at age 103.

Many people might remember Wouk for a certain incident involving strawberries in The Caine Mutiny, which became a film in 1954. After having a breakdown at sea, the tyrannical Captain Queeg accuses his crew of stealing a quart of strawberries and becomes obsessed with finding the culprit.

Humphrey Bogart played Queeg in the film, but he wasn't exactly what Wouk had in mind when he wrote the character. In the book, Wouk described the captain as ""a small man"" with ""strands of sandy hair across an almost bald head."" In 2004, the author told NPR, ""Now Captain Queeg is Humphrey Bogart. There's nothing you can do about it, and I'm perfectly content with [it.] That was one of the great performances, I think, of his career.""

The Caine Mutiny was Wouk's most celebrated book, but he had a substantial career both before and after it. He got his start in writing years earlier, in comedy. For five years starting in 1936, Wouk wrote jokes and sketches for the popular radio host Fred Allen. But after Pearl Harbor, the 26-year-old enlisted in the Navy and served in the Pacific. In his off hours, Wouk began to write Aurora Dawn, a novel that got mixed reviews. His second book, City Boy, did worse. But The Caine Mutiny put him on the map. It won a Pulitzer Prize, it was a bestseller and it became a play and a movie.

Wouk told NPR, ""When I finished The Caine Mutiny, I wrote in my work journal ... 'Unless I'm mistaken, this is a good book. But it's not yet the war novel I mean to write.' ""

In fact, it was the first in a run of ambitious books that included The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, each about a thousand pages long. And war wasn't Wouk's only subject. He wrote about the publishing world, a fictional Caribbean island and the founding of Israel. And in Marjorie Morningstar, he tapped into his own heritage as a New York-born child of Jewish immigrants to tell the story of a young girl trying to break into show business.

""He really was the Jackie Robinson of Jewish American fiction,"" says Jonathan Karp, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster and editor of Wouk's last book, Sailor and Fiddler. ""He was on the cover of Time magazine for Marjorie Morningstar, and he popularized a lot of themes that other writers — like [Saul] Bellow and [Philip] Roth and [Bernard] Malamud — would deal with in their novels.""

Karp says that one of the reasons Wouk appealed to readers for so many years was the variety in his novels. ""He really did not want to write the same novel twice. The writers he admired were the greats — they were the Victorian novelists, they were writers like [Thomas] Hardy. He wanted to write big novels about complicated lives and the cultures in which they took place.""

Despite his popularity with readers, Wouk didn't always get a good critical response. The New York Times called The Winds of War long and ""mildly interesting"" with an ""indifference to quality"" and a ""reliance on clichés.""

According to Karp, many of the critics missed the point. ""One of the reasons why he didn't get the kind of stellar reviews that writers like Saul Bellow got was because he was accessible."" And Wouk did express serious ideas in his fiction. In one section of War and Remembrance, he reflects on the Holocaust:

But Karp says Wouk was the writer to tell these stories. ""I think he aimed high and had large ambitions for reaching a lot of readers — and he entertained millions of them."" And with all of his major works still in print, chances are that in the years to come, Herman Wouk will entertain millions more.","Herman Wouk, 'The Jackie Robinson Of Jewish-American Fiction,' Dies At 103"
303,ENTERTAINMENT,"Aric Chen is curator-at-large at M+, a new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong, and professor of practice at Tongji University's College of Design & Innovation in Shanghai.

I.M. Pei, who died Thursday at the age of 102, was an architect of singular vision. One of the great figures of 20th century modernism, he was perhaps best known for his powerful use of geometry. He employed it to create forms and spaces of exquisite refinement, from his glass pyramid at the Louvre in Paris to the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

He brought to his work the notion that good architecture served a higher civic purpose. But at the same time, Pei was an architect of multiple dimensions.

He did not plan to stay in the US when he arrived from China to study in 1935. His thesis projects at MIT and Harvard -- a mobile media and recreation center for rural China and a modern art museum for Shanghai, respectively -- signaled his intention to return to his native country.

Nevertheless, war and upheaval got in the way. Pei and his wife Eileen Loo, a Harvard classmate, would call New York home for the rest of their lives.

Famously charming, with dapper style and a beaming smile, Pei easily straddled, and found clients in, the worlds of both culture and commerce. However, success did not always come easy.

Before seducing Paris, he utterly scandalized the city with his proposal for a glass pyramid at the Louvre, a then-radical proposal for a site seen by many as representing the soul of France. (And by a Chinese-American architect, no less!) His John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston was, for years, mired in controversy, and he considered the construction of the Fragrant Hill Hotel outside Beijing -- one of the first buildings designed by an international architect in reform-era China -- to be one of the most painful experiences of his professional life.

But with these projects, and others, Pei sought timelessness and, at this point, it seems fair to say he achieved it.

He did so, often, by forging his own path. A student of the revered Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer while at Harvard, Pei broke with his profession's gentile conventions when, in the late 1940s, he dared to start his career working for a real estate developer: the brash, larger-than-life William Zeckendorf.

Along with a formidable assortment of colleagues and collaborators, he also pioneered new construction techniques, especially in concrete. Later in life, with buildings like the Miho Museum outside Kyoto and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, he deftly translated his modernist vocabulary into different cultural contexts, and perhaps nowhere more so than in China.

Pei returned to China for the first time in 1974 as part of a delegation of American architects. Soon thereafter, officials asked Pei to design a modern high-rise hotel in central Beijing -- an aspirational gesture for the then-impoverished nation.

Concerned about the effect such a building would have on the capital's historic character, Pei refused. Instead, he selected a site on the city's wooded outskirts and produced a low-rise complex, the Fragrant Hill Hotel, whose white walls and relationship with its landscape were inspired by the classical architecture and gardens of Suzhou, the Pei family's ancestral home. (There, the architect would later design perhaps his best project in the country, the Suzhou Museum.)

Pei always referred to himself as an American architect, but he never forgot that he was also Chinese. Perhaps this dual sense of identity helped him operate so fluidly in multiple worlds.

I had the good fortune of meeting Pei, though only once, when he was a sprightly 95-year-old. I simply wanted an interview. But against the better judgement of his son, he insisted that we have lunch beforehand at his old haunt, the Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan.

Lunch with Pei, I learned, always meant plenty of good wine, and this time was no exception. The interview suffered as a result, but, true to Pei's reputation, it was a pleasure nonetheless.","A tribute to I.M. Pei, a disarming and determined visionary"
304,ENTERTAINMENT,"The end has almost arrived: Game of Thrones concludes this weekend, and we're taking a look ahead at what to expect. You'll find what HBO has offered us below, but we also have a look at Young Griff and Dany's descent into madness.

The long-awaited series finale of Game of Thrones is just two days away. Season 8, Episode 6 premieres on HBO this Sunday, May 19, marking the end of both this six-episode season and the series overall that started back in 2011. We've already gotten a preview trailer, which initially debuted right after Episode 5, and now has HBO has released photos from the next episode--but they're a bit different than we are used to getting each week. There are Episode 5 spoilers ahead, but you can safely take a look even if you don't want to know much about Episode 6.

HBO is usually quite reticent to spoil the upcoming episode with its previews; these aren't exactly modern movie trailers giving away major story beats and moments. The brief Episode 6 teaser kept the specifics to a real minimum, and now the preview photos are doing the same. They don't give away anything that wasn't already in the trailer, and just as notably, HBO has only shared a mere two images, which is far less than we typically see. Clearly, the network wants whatever is coming to be a surprise (although this does nothing to deal with the possibility of leaks, which have been a problem all season long).

The first of the two photos features Tyrion, who can be seen standing amongst the rubble in King's Landing. He doesn't look particularly pleased, just as you'd expect; he put his support behind Daenerys and believed in her, and he even put his life at risk to free Jaime in the hopes of preventing a massacre of innocents in the city. Dany opted to go Mad Queen instead, and now Tyrion is faced with having to live with this reality that Varys tried to stop. (While it's too late to save those who have died, Varys may have been planning to poison Dany, which could make her reign as the leader of Westeros a very short one.)

The second photo matches up with a shot from the preview trailer. Dany, standing victorious on the edges of the burning city, faces away from us with her back to the camera as her army stands in formation all around her. If there was any question about how many troops she had remaining after Episode 3's battle, it looks like she's doing just fine in that regard.

Her troops appear to be in full support of her, and we know from the preview trailer that the Dothraki in particular seem pleased with the outcome of the battle. But we still haven't seen Dany's face in Episode 6, or really, since she made her fateful decision to destroy the city. Seeing if she has any remorse will have to wait for this Sunday, though it's too late to undo her actions. Queen of the Ashes might be the best she can hope for at this point. Whatever her attitude, her decision to burn them all (as her father, the Mad King, once attempted to) has confirmed Game of Thrones isn't what we thought.

In the meantime, we have Episode 6 theories about where things in the finale and an Episode 5 breakdown.","Game Of Thrones Finale Photos: HBO Refuses To Spoil Episode 6, Season 8"
305,ENTERTAINMENT,"Viral, genre-defying “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X, and featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, now has an official movie. Not a music video, but a movie. It’s cinema, baby.

The movie starts out with Lil Nas X and Cyrus in the Wild West circa 1889, hiding out after their latest successful bank robbery. When they’re chased off by a gunslinging cowboy, Lil Nas X dives into a wormhole — and lands in 2019. He wanders the new old town road with his horse, stumbling through modern day streets. Chris Rock is also there. So is Detective Pikachu co-star Diplo. Billy Ray dons sparkly pink cowboy attire. They end up in a bingo hall with a Western theme. It’s amazing.

The five-minute-long Western is every bit as genre-defying and epic as the saga of the song it is based on.

Lil Nas X uploaded the first music video for “Old Town Road” to YouTube in December 2018, setting the song to clips of his character from Red Dead Online. In 2019, the song crept onto TikTok, and blew up as a meme. The standard riff involved dancing to the song, then switching into cowboy attire once the bass dropped, though there were plenty of subversions to come.

In March, the song debuted on the BIllboard Country Music chart — and was promptly removed because Billboard declared it wasn’t country enough. This prompted outrage not only from Lil Nas X fans and TikTok members, as well as established country musicians. In early April, Lil Nas X released a remix, featuring country crooner Billy Ray Cyrus. Part of the video alludes to the Billboard fiasco.

“I don’t know, man,” says Cowboy Lil Nas X, after Billy Ray declares that the duo should settle in for the night. “Last time I was here, they weren’t too welcoming to outsiders.”

The saga of “Old Town Road” didn’t conclude with the Billy Ray Cyrus remix: Other artists have covered it, including rapper CupcaKKe with the raunchy “Old Town Hoe,” and the memes haven’t died down, especially now that it’s moved out of the TikTok space and into the mainstream. Thank the penultimate episode of Game of Thrones for keeping things alive.

With this foray into cinema, “Old Town Road” has done it all, having been a video game music video, a TikTok meme, a chart topper, and a music industry disrupter. It’s spawned memes across all social networks, has inspired other artists to try their hand at some Yeehaw music, and now blesses us with Billy Ray Cyrus in a pink cowboy suit.",The official Old Town Road movie is the perfect addition to the song’s meme saga
306,ENTERTAINMENT,"In January, paparazzi agency Splash News chartered a helicopter to take aerial photographs of Prince Harry's Oxfordshire home. The resulting images, which were published in numerous publications, featured views of ""the living area and dining area of the home and directly into the bedroom.""

Following the photos' syndication, Harry and Meghan Markle were forced to move out of the privately rented house. Harry chose to bring a legal case against Splash News, drawing a line in the sand for how far he and Meghan will allow the press to intrude.

A statement read in court detailed the terms of Harry's out-of-court settlement, and explained how the photos had harmed the couple. ""The syndication and publication of the photographs very seriously undermined the safety and security of the duke and the home to the extent that they are no longer able to live at the property,"" it read.

Today, Harry was awarded a ""significant"" (though undisclosed) sum of money in damages. ""The duke was awarded a significant sum towards damages and legal fees, which will be put towards a donation to charity and covering the duke’s legal costs,"" a spokeswoman for Prince Harry told the Guardian.

Splash News has issued a public apology, noting, ""this situation represents an error of judgement and we have taken steps to ensure it will not be repeated."" Harry has offered a statement in response, saying that he ""acknowledges and welcomes the formal apology.""

Royal reporter Victoria Murphy noted on Twitter that Harry's decision to pursue legal action could be a sign of things to come. It ""very much sets the tone that The Sussexes won’t hesitate to take action in the future if they feel there is unjust intrusion into their family life,"" she wrote.",Prince Harry Awarded “Significant Sum” in Legal Settlement Over Photos Taken of His Home
307,ENTERTAINMENT,"Snapchat filters—love’em or hate’em, about once a year one goes viral, floods your timeline, and you think to yourself, “Oh yeah, Snapchat still exists.”

This week, Snapchat’s gender swap filter exploded all over social media. You could hardly scroll through Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook without seeing gender-bent versions of your family, friends, ex-lovers, celebrities, coworkers, your neighbor’s uncle’s cousin thrice removed, and so on and so forth.

We at the Gizmodo office are also guilty of spending an afternoon gawping at our other selves. One of our reporters, pictured right, was a dead ringer for that PTA mom who loses it because a teacher dared to hand out a non-organic juice box. We also ran the filter on some of our favorite tech CEOs just for the hell of it. (For the record, Mark Zuckerberg is still inexplicably sweaty when his image is run through the lady filter and a bit more handsome when given the guy filter treatment.)



But it wouldn’t really be a viral Snapchat filter if there wasn’t a culturally tone-deaf undercurrent. Remember that racially insensitive Bob Marley filter? Or how about that sexist Marie Curie one? Or that godawful yellowface filter? For some in the LGBTQ community, the filters were overly glib with regard to gender dysphoria—a reminder that trans and nonbinary people are openly persecuted for their gender presentation, while cisgender folk can simply play dress-up and close an app. Others noted that the filter was a useful tool to help envision what a future transition or gender experimentation might look like. Some praised the ensuing discourse, and others were critical the filters relied heavily on gender stereotypes. The woman filter, in particular, thinks everyone should have pencil thin eyebrows, shaved jaws, light makeup, and lightened skin.

That’s not to say the filter is universally malicious. My mom got a kick out of a text I sent wishing her a Happy Mother’s Day from her fictional son Victor. It was also kind of heartwarming to see my aunt and mom giggle at how much their male selves resembled my recently departed grandpa. But, at the same time, this is Snapchat’s fourth filter that brazenly skirts the line between mildly amusing and offensive.

Snapchat did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

A more cynical look is Snapchat’s riding that fine line to boost its download numbers. It’s only recently stopped bleeding users, who have been flocking to other platforms like Instagram and TikTok. To partake in the gender-swap zeitgeist, people who deleted the app or never downloaded it in the first place would have to re-up with Snapchat just to post on other social media. And, it’s not as if Snapchat is unaware of gender swapping’s viral potential. Back in 2017, FaceApp blew up for the exact same reason and sparked the exact same discussions within the trans community.

So maybe the real problem is we’ll all have our fun, learn nothing, and then have the exact same discussion the next time this rolls around.",Snapchat's Viral Garbage Machine Strikes Again
308,ENTERTAINMENT,"Self-help guru Tony Robbins is accused of sexually harassing fans and staffers — when he’s not berating victims of rape and violence in expletive-filled rants, according to a scathing new report.

The famed 59-year-old motivational speaker’s alleged misconduct includes having his bodyguards troll audiences for attractive female fans to bring to him, a BuzzFeed investigation revealed Friday.

Robbins, who has been married to his second wife since 2001, is additionally accused of exposing himself to two staffers, the report said.

Secret recordings obtained by BuzzFeed allegedly revealed that the “Awaken the Giant Within” author also has been horrific to some women who have come up to the microphone at his popular multiday events and revealed they were raped and emotionally and physically abused.

When a female guest, speaking at a December 2018 seminar in Palm Beach, Florida, said her husband emotionally abused her, Robbins reportedly dismissed her as only “focused on her needs.”

“We’ve not heard one thing in the last 12 minutes about his needs. And we’re already characterizing it as emotional violence. There’s no f–king thing,” he said, according to BuzzFeed.

The woman clarified to Robbins that there was physical violence.

“What role did you play?” Robbins said, according to the site. “I’m not suggesting there’s any excuse for hitting a woman, so hear me. But I also want you to know that people don’t just act a certain f–king way.”

Robbins later allegedly added, “Has he looked out for you, does he put up with you when you’ve been a crazy b—h? Have you ever been a crazy b—h? Ever?”

The female guest has since identified herself as Analay Souza Campos and rejected the report’s characterization of what she called a “sacred moment” between her and the motivational speaker, according to an open letter and Youtube link Robbins later posted to the Web site Medium.

In the YouTube video, Campos said the transcript from his intervention with her was taken “out of context.” She plugged her own self-help book as evidence Robbins “served her a lot.”

But other encounters revealed the guru repeatedly tore into his followers, according to Buzzfeed.

In another incident, Robbins shot back at a woman who claimed she was raped, the report said.

“She’s f–king using all this stuff to try and control men,” Robbins allegedly said.

Robbins would hit on single women in his crowds, telling one female guest to “come up on stage to make love to me,” according to BuzzFeed.

Two former bodyguards told the site he enlisted them to prowl audiences for attractive women to bring to him.

Ex-staffers said they were also sexually harassed by the self-help guru.

A former assistant who worked for him in the 1990s said he would make her take notes when he was in the shower.

“He would call you into the bathroom with him. ‘Hey come here, I need you to make a note of something,’” she told BuzzFeed. “He just didn’t care, he was too powerful.”

Robbins’ lawyers said he was “never intentionally naked” in the presence of staffers.

“To the extent that he may have been unclothed at various times in his home or in hotels when working while either dressing or showering, and whether a personal assistant may have been present for some reason at that time, Mr. Robbins has no recollection,” his lawyers told the news outlet.

The lawyers said they had “not been given enough time to respond fully” to the investigation’s allegations but “threatened legal action that would have a devastating impact on the financial condition of BuzzFeed and its investors,” according to the site.

Robbins claimed in his letter to Medium that the report was an “inaccurate, agenda-driven version of the past, pierced with falsehoods.

“Let me be clear, while my open-classroom therapeutic methods are not for everyone, and while I am on my best day still only an imperfect being, I have never behaved in the reckless, irresponsible, or malicious manner intimated by false, unfounded, and incendiary allegations suggested by Buzzfeed story-tellers,” Robbins wrote.","Tony Robbins accused of sexual misconduct, berating rape victims"

312,ENTERTAINMENT,"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) Always camp, often cheesy and occasionally political, the Eurovision Song Contest rarely passes off without some kind of controversy.

But this year's competition isn't making headlines because of a voting irregularity, an on-stage outrage or an obscure rules infraction. The issue is the location of the event itself.

Last year, the contest -- which pits singers and bands from different countries against each other in a week-long competition culminating in a spectacular live final -- was won by a quirky singer called Netta Barzilai, representing Israel (despite the title, entries are not restricted to European nations).

And because the winning nation gets to host the following year's contest, this year the Eurovision caravan has pitched up in Tel Aviv.

The nature of the controversy is clear on landing at Ben Gurion Airport. Signs welcoming visitors to the contest are followed on the road into the city by a billboard protesting against Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.

The rival messages underline the contrast between Israel's sunny Mediterranean beaches and the concrete wall and checkpoints that run along parts of the border with the West Bank. It is an attempt to remind visitors that just a short drive away is an ongoing, and intractable, conflict.

Eurovision is best known for its glitzy costumes, quirky performances, and national pride. Despite its well-honed message that the event is above politics, the big issue of the day almost always casts its shadow.

This year is no exception.

Israel is using the Eurovision song competition as a way to brand itself as a fun, sunny holiday break for tourists. It's part of the country's larger effort to promote itself not only as a place for religious and historical tourism, but also for its beaches, food scene and high-tech startups.

Israel has poured millions of dollars into the event, which it last hosted in 1999. The competition is taking place at Expo Tel Aviv, while across the city satellite events, performances and festivals are taking place all week long.

Nearly 200 million people are expected to tune in to watch the final on Saturday. The televised week-long competition pits 41 countries' contestants against each other in a series of rounds. Half of a contestant's final standing is determined by a jury, while the other half comes from a public vote.

Four people in Israel and more than 20 people in Gaza were killed in the two days of fighting, before mediators managed to restore a ceasefire, all of it coinciding with the start of the Eurovision rehearsals.

Activists in the country are keen to take advantage of the world spotlight, calling for boycotts of the event over Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.

""Breaking the Silence,"" an organization started by former soldiers which wants to see Israel withdraw from Palestinian territories, paid for the billboard along the highway.

""We want people to come that first of all come and see the bigger picture -- to enjoy Israel, to enjoy Tel Aviv, but also open their eyes to the fact we occupy millions of people against their will,"" the group's communications director Achiya Schatz told CNN. ""For us, if you want to build bridges through music, you need to take apart walls that are being built by occupation.""

On Tuesday evening as thousands flocked to the Tel Aviv beaches for free performances and a food festival, around 150 protesters took part in a short march calling on Israel to end its actions in Gaza.

""The eyes of Europe are on us, so we want to use it to hold up Europe [so it can] see what happens in Gaza, and do something about it,"" said one of the protesters, Mattan Helman. ""We want them to stop the party, to come with us, to work together and to see that there is another thing that happens 100km from them -- to see the lives [of people in Gaza and] to understand that this is also part of their life, because they affect each other. The life in Gaza affects the life in Israel, and the life in Israel affects the life in Gaza.""

But for most people in Tel Aviv the focus is on the festive atmosphere and the opportunity to show that Tel Aviv can successfully host a major international event.

At the Eurovision fan village along the beach, locals and visitors alike said they were impressed by the event.

""We're celebrating Eurovision, celebrating freedom, celebrating good music,"" said Yanit Azulin as she danced with friends. ""The vibe is great, it's enormous, it's amazing. I'm very glad that we are here celebrating.""

Despite calls for her to boycott the event, Madonna said in a statement she will ""never stop playing music to suit someone's political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be.""

""My heart breaks every time I hear about the innocent lives that are lost in this region and the violence that is so often perpetuated to suit the political goals of people who benefit from this ancient conflict. I hope and pray that we will soon break free from this terrible cycle of destruction and create a new path towards peace,"" the statement continued.

Protests also came from religious Ultra-Orthodox Jews in the country, angered that the contest requires people to work and perform during the Sabbath which occurs from sundown on Fridays until sundown on Saturday (though the finale should begin after sundown on Saturday). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to explain the government did not control the Eurovision competition to one of the political parties he is trying to form a coalition with, after they expressed dismay about the competition's timing.

Netta Barzilai, the reigning Eurovision champion whose winning song ""Toy"" brought the competition to Israel, has been promoting the event as a way to bring a positive message to the world.

""It's insane to bring so much blessing over here. And we are thrilled for people to discover Israel again and to see [what] amazing people we are, and how warm we are accepting everyone. It's going to be a party,"" Barzilai said at a news conference ahead of the semi-finals. ""From all these countries, all these cultures are bound together, this is a festival of light.""",Eurovision faces backlash as musical kitschfest hits Israel
313,ENTERTAINMENT,"Imagine if Avengers: Endgame was the first Marvel movie. Not storywise, of course. That would be silly. But think about a team-up, comic book movie on this scale coming into theaters, sight unseen. Logistically, that feels like a nightmare for a ton of reasons, especially if a company (or several) was tasked with first conceptualizing, then designing, crafting, and eventually digitally creating all of those characters, all from scratch, for a single movie.



Fortunately, for Marvel Studios and one of its visual effects partners, Industrial Light and Magic, everyone came into Endgame with some experience. ILM has worked on more than half of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date and, when we talked to visual effects supervisor Russell Earl (who also had that job for Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Ant-Man and the Wasp before Endgame), he said while that backlog of work was helpful, it’s not as useful as one may assume.

“It’s always good having done the work but, that said, every time [the filmmakers and the studio] want it to be different or better,” he said, “In this case, it was helpful that we had done [Marvel movies] before so we had some good targets and we knew what we needed to do.”

ILM may know what it needs to do, but the company can’t just go into its hard drives, download the most recent Iron Man suit and pop it into Endgame. What it can do is utilize people who’ve previously worked with those assets and solved problems for them, making things run smoother. Earl and his team worked on three previous movies with the Endgame directors, Joe and Anthony Russo and he believes that relationship is more fruitful than anything tech-based.

“We know how Joe and Anthony like to work and how the studio works,” Earl said. “They’re all about the story and we’re here to serve that story and help put the best images that we can on screen. We were lucky in that having done the prior films, we got a good idea of where it could go [and] how they like to work. I think knowing that and being prepared to roll with changes [helps].”

However, not every character in Endgame had a strong history at Marvel Studios or ILM. In the film, Earl and his team worked on several Captain Marvel scenes at the same time as their colleagues were working on effects for the Captain Marvel solo movie, which would come out beforehand and define the look of the character.

In Endgame, ILM did all the shots of Captain Marvel arriving on Earth and blowing up Thanos’ ship single-handedly. Interestingly, those shots used very little of what was actually captured in-camera, on-set.

“That’s an instance where she was shot on blue screen being lifted up on wires,” Earl said of Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers flying around. “[Digitally] we kept her head. Her hair is CG and her body becomes CG as well. And that’s true for the other shots, like the Iron Man shots where we’re sort of keeping the actor’s head and then replacing everything else just to give you the fit of the suit and better action.”

The character is at the height of her powers at this point, which hadn’t been seen on screen yet, so Earl was happy to have the other film being worked on just down the hall.

‘We’re fortunate in that ILM worked on a lot of the binary effects [in Captain Marvel],” Earl said. “So I could go talk to Craig [Hammarck, the visual effects supervisor for Captain Marvel] and just say ‘What’s going on?’” Hammarck worked on Black Panther too, which put the company in a similar conundrum a year earlier.

“We had a similar thing on Infinity War where Black Panther hadn’t come out yet and we were working on the film not knowing who any of these people were,” Earl said. “It’s always fun because once you see the film you’re like ‘Oh I get it! That’s who that is! Now that makes a lot more sense.’ The characters are key to Marvel’s success and they just want to make sure that we keep that going and stay true to what they are in the standalone films like Black Panther and Captain Marvel.”

And, of course, when compared to the suit she wears in Captain Marvel, the Endgame one different.

“Oh, the costume changed. The costume always changes,” Earl joked. “It’s funny. Having been on Winter Soldier through this last movie, the costumes always change just a little bit, whether something is a little bit darker or something gets tweaked here and there.”

So while working on all the other movies helps from a base level, everything ends up being new anyway. Knowing that, at the end of our interview, I asked Earl if Endgame was the first movie in a franchise, and none of this had been worked on before, would it even be possible?

“I mean it would be a huge undertaking,” he said. “I think if you’re going into it without [previous work and relationships] it would definitely be a much, much bigger challenge. There’s just so much to keep track of throughout the film. There’s just so much going on. So, yeah, while it could be done it would have been a big challenge.”

315,ENTERTAINMENT,"Mick Jagger appears to be recovering well after reportedly undergoing heart valve surgery last month. The legendary ""Rolling Stones"" frontman posted video of him dancing energetically Wednesday –– much to the delight of adoring fans and fellow musicians.

The 75-year-old Jagger shared a 22-second video of his workout on Twitter and it shows him moving fluidly to The Wombats' song ""Techno Fan."" He didn't include any text in the tweet, but the footage speaks for itself -- surgery wasn't going to hold him back from performing on stage.

His recovery also appears to be going on schedule. Jagger was supposed to return with the band over the summer and a tweet on Thursday with 17 tour dates backs that timeline up. His first concert since surgery for the band's ""No Filter"" tour is scheduled for June 21 in Chicago.

Fans of Jagger were in awe of the iconic singer and songwriter, including some big names.

Maroon Five commented on the video, saying ""#MovesLike..."" -- in reference to their ""Moves Like Jagger"" song dedicated to the Rolling Stones star's distinctive dancing moves. Imagine Dragons singer Dan Reynolds tweeted: ""nobody more badass and timeless. period.""

Others pointed out how it was possible Jagger was moving so actively at his age.

""He's 75 years old, what is this devilry?"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another user said, ""Breaking: Mick Jagger is actually Benjamin Button.""

The Rolling Stones announced on March 30 that the band was postponing their tour over health reasons involving Jagger. He reportedly had successful surgery less than a week later. Drudge Report first reported Jagger was going to have heart valve surgery and that the procedure was happening in New York. The normal recovery time after heart valve surgery is typically four to eight weeks, according to the American Heart Association.","Mick Jagger posts dancing video weeks after reported heart surgery, and fans can't believe it"

“A gift from my brother Nipsey that we want to share with the world. We miss you and we will forever keep your legacy going. The Marathon Continues. God Bless You,” tweeted Khaled.

Khaled revealed in a statement that the music video was filmed just days before Hussle, whose given name was Ermias Asghedom, was killed outside of his Marathon clothing store in his home city of Los Angeles. The hit-making producer also confirmed that he’s releasing the video with the full permission of Asghedom’s family.

“Recently, I embarked on a soul-searching journey down a road I never thought I would travel in a million years,” the statement read.

“It began when a tragedy robbed the world of an enlightened soul, a brother, a father, a partner and my friend, Nipsey Hussle. Just days prior, he shared his energy and positivity with me on a video set for a song called ‘Higher.’ After much prayer and reflection; and with the full blessing of the Asghedom family, I am sharing that moment with the world,” it continued.

Khaled also shared that the collaboration will solely benefit Asghedom’s young children.

“The very title of the song reminds us that vibrating on a ‘Higher’ level was the essence of Nipsey’s soul,” Khaled wrote. “It is in this spirit, of moving forward, of preserving his mission, that I, my co-writers, producers, and label partners are donating 100% of all our proceeds from ‘Higher’ to Nipsey’s children, Emani and Kross.”

John Legend, who is also featured on the song and is shown in the video playing a piano with Hussle and Khaled surrounding him, expressed his commitment to supporting Asghedom’s children as well.

323,ENTERTAINMENT,"CANNES, France — The apocalypse arrived early at the Cannes Film Festival. In “The Dead Don’t Die,” the latest from Jim Jarmusch and this year’s opening selection, catastrophe takes the form of zombies, who rise from their graves to destroy the living. It’s the end of the world as we know it, which Jarmusch reminds us, is entirely our fault. “Polar fracking” has thrown Earth off its axis and now Iggy Pop is gnawing on innards that (this being a Jarmusch joint) he washes down with coffee.

The 72nd festival has a similarly admirable energy and staying power. Despite a decline in moviegoing in Europe and the global embrace of streaming, Cannes remains a proud monument to the theatrical experience. It’s holding firm even if this year’s edition seems slightly less jammed than in the past, which may have something to do with the intense security. Heavily armed police and soldiers patrol the area around the festival’s headquarters, a reminder of security measures instituted after a series of terrorist attacks.

But on Tuesday, opening night, as Michael Jackson blared on loudspeakers (Cannes can be very tin-eared in its choices), all eyes and innumerable cameras were on the red carpet, where Jarmusch’s stars — Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Adam Driver, Selena Gomez — paraded under a gray sky. Inside, they and the rest of the audience endured a ceremony that threatened to drag on as long as the Oscars.

324,ENTERTAINMENT,"The first season of Fleabag was so perfectly precise, acerbically funny, emotionally deep, and genuinely cool that I wished I loved it more. The show stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge—also its creator, writer, director, and the world’s best wearer of a wide variety of black jumpsuits—as Fleabag, an imp who cracks jokes while drowning in grief and loneliness, sporting the perfect shade of lipstick as she torpedoes her life with sex. Barely keeping it together, she mugs and flirts and toys with the audience, breaking the fourth wall in a continuous demonstration of her character’s pathological inability to not be fun. She’s the life of the party even though her life is a wreck, and I watched her quip and weep and self-sabotage with unwelcome detachment. This should be my kind of show! Why didn’t I like it more?

In art, as in life, sometimes you just have to meet again. Fleabag Season 2, which I cannot recommend highly enough, is thrillingly deep, funny, and buoyant. (All six episodes arrive on Amazon Prime this Friday.) In it, Waller-Bridge ransacks every trick in artistry’s store, availing herself of violence, pratfalls, fart jokes, flashbacks, witty repartee, sex scenes, tears, trauma, cute animals (depending on how you feel about guinea pigs and hamsters), and a total mastery of her characters to build a bang-up romantic comedy, not just in the narrow genre sense (though it is great example of the genre) but a larger one too, examining a number of very specific, ineluctably loving relationships in all their funny, sad, twisted forms. In the opening scene of the new season, as she’s wiping up her bloody nose and wearing—of course—a smashing jumpsuit, Fleabag cuts her eyes at the camera and explains, “This is a love story.”

The new season picks up a little over a year after the events of the last, with Fleabag in a marginally better place. Her little café, through a series of extraordinarily twee interventions, has become a success, and she has forsworn the wanton sleeping around that filled the empty hole in her soul while tanking her life. She has not spoken to her icily uptight sister Claire (Sian Clifford) since the messy events of the season before, but the two meet again at a family dinner, celebrating the engagement of their spacey father (Bill Paterson) and their deliciously despicable godmother, played with glorious unctuousness by the incomparable Olivia Colman. Joining them for dinner is Claire’s sleazy husband Martin (a scenery-chewing Brett Gelman, who much later on, has maybe my favorite line of the season: “I’m not a bad person, I just have a bad personality!”) and a stranger—a funny, dashing, cursing, high-energy Catholic priest (Andrew Scott).*

With extreme economy, Waller-Bridge re-establishes the relevant characters and relationships at this one farcical dinner, and sets them rolling on their way, in particular the season’s two main relationships: the one between Fleabag and her sister, which starts with a characteristically deranged rapprochement that plays on Claire’s wildly overdetermined sense of boundaries and Fleabag’s nonexistent sense of the same; and of course, the one between Fleabag and the priest (identified in the credits only as The Priest).

If Fleabag has cut down on total self-sabotage, she has not entirely given up on mischief. After the priest says just the right thing to her—cheekily telling her to fuck off—she seeks him out, thrilling a bit to the idea that she might, if she gets it just right, find herself entangled in a love triangle with God. But the priest is more than she bargained for. He, to use a description Fleabag’s own father uses to describe her, also has “the fun gene.” Their double helixes recognize one another.

There’s a scene in The Notebook in which young lovers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are on a beach, and she commands him, “Say I’m a bird.” The line seems to demand a cheesy, groan-worthy reading, but McAdams finds the truth in it, the way to deliver it so it’s sincere but silly—she’s playing a kid, allowing herself to be her goofiest self with this person, whom she trusts completely. I think about this scene a lot when I think about good acting, and I thought about it when Scott has to deliver a whole monologue about his dread of foxes, who are freakily obsessed with him. Fleabag has dropped by his house, unannounced, a little too late, and they’re drinking in the yard. They have arrived at the subject of celibacy—Fleabag, like a high-schooler, is constantly trying to push her crush into a conversational terrain where he will confess his feelings for her, or even better, wound her by failing to do so—when he thinks he sees a fox and is completely overcome by the need to explain his strange history with them. Scott puts so much spinning, spazzy, neurotic energy into it that he makes this story, this antic stalling, into something wonderfully real, not just an outlet for all the flirtatious energy between them but a kind of helplessness not to tell this oft-repeated story, and tell it so well.

As the two sip G&Ts in the rectory way too early in the morning and go shopping for vestments, as she reads the Bible in the bathtub (he’s given it to her, like some dudes might suggest Infinite Jest), and says inappropriate things at Quaker meetings—“I worry that I wouldn’t be such a feminist if I had larger tits”—it becomes clear he’s perfect for her, except for the whole devotion-to-God and life-of-celibacy thing. For the priest, these things are not a joke, though Fleabag doesn’t quite believe it. She describes him as being in a bad relationship, “the kind where one partner tells the other how to dress.” But his faith is real. When Fleabag tells him she’s an atheist and a picture suddenly falls off the wall, he grins and shakes his head: “I love it when He does that.” It’s intimated that his past has also involved sex that came to no good end, and that God, and a different kind of love for people, has been his solution to a problem—of how to live—that Fleabag is still making her way through.

I am overjoyed for my major complaint about Fleabag to be that there is not enough of it—the opposite problem of basically every other show on television.

As Fleabag and the priest’s roller coaster rolls on, it’s twinned with a different kind of love story: the one between Fleabag and Claire. Fleabag and Claire’s relationship is even more of a whiplash thing, so intimate except when it’s completely estranged. As sisters, instead of friends, they are stuck together, and this mandatory connection makes their relationship oddly capacious, containing so many divergent ways of relating to each another. Standing in her hilariously vast office, the professionally successful Claire yells that Fleabag, a struggling café owner with no friends, always makes her feel like she’s less-than (you know exactly what she means), and then, without ever apologizing or making amends, phones Fleabag for support after the worst has happened (a bad haircut). Fleabag is the oxygen-hogging little sister Claire resents but also adores, while Fleabag, who thinks she knows Claire extraordinarily well—she’s constantly mugging to the camera about Claire’s true feelings—can’t quite clock her. Late in the show, as the two discuss the romantic-comedy possibility of Claire running after a man in an airport, Claire tells Fleabag, sincerely, “The only person I would run through an airport for is you,” the kind of mash note that will keep them going through decades more disagreements.

One thing Claire doesn’t do is push; she and Fleabag have accepted each other’s limitations. But there are other people in Fleabag’s life who are not so accepting of her boundaries. “I just want to know you,” the priest tells Fleabag, after asking her a series of questions she has deflected like a backstop. She snaps back, “I don’t want that.” In another scene with a therapist, played by Fiona Shaw—the episode also features a fantastic cameo from Kristen Scott Thomas—the therapist drills down to Fleabag’s loneliness. She’s not close with her family. She has no friends. Fleabag is uncomfortable hearing what she has said repeated back to her, only without the jokes. She’s so uncomfortable that she defensively claims that she does have a friend, one who is always there, one who, her eye contact with the camera makes clear, is … us?

Fleabag has always been a consummate fourth wall breaker, but in the second season of the show it becomes clear that’s not exactly what she’s doing. Yes, she is looking at the camera and pulling faces and narrating and making asides, but this is not happening outside of the reality of the show. Rather, when Fleabag is talking to the audience, she is noticeably absenting herself from her real life. “Where do you go?” the priest asks her when she has just glanced at the camera. At one point, he follows her eyes, until he too is thrillingly looking straight into the lens, somehow catching both Fleabag and the audience out in a conversation we shouldn’t have been having. Who exactly is Fleabag speaking to? Her best friend, her mother, her grief, some kind of imagined audience, some kind of real audience? (Fleabag did begin as a stage show, performed in front of real people, after all.) Whoever it is, it’s a way for her to escape, to keep everything at a distance, to crack jokes with some unseen party, instead of inhabiting her actual life.

As the season comes racing to a close, Fleabag’s relationships with other people start to become secondary to the question of whether she can sort out her relationship with herself, so as to fully inhabit the world. The ending is hopeful, but, to my mind, a little rushed. What a joy, for my major complaint about a TV show to be that there is not enough of it—the opposite problem of basically every other show on television—but I hope Waller-Bridge one day reconsiders making this Fleabag’s last season. There’s more to know about Fleabag, both her past—how exactly did she and her sister turn out this way?—and also her future: What on earth is Fleabag like in an actual relationship? Romantic comedies may stop after the happy ending, but Fleabag could go on and on.","Fleabag’s Second Season Is a Profane, Profound Romantic Comedy With Jumpsuits"
325,ENTERTAINMENT,"The CW has ordered a TV adaptation of Nancy Drew to series, and we really can’t stress enough that this show is going all in on the ghosts. The trailer basically transports the dark and sexy vibe of Riverdale into another typically more earnest young-adult property, with Kennedy McMann playing a brooding version of the young sleuth who ends up falsely accused of murder! She investigates, and of course, ends up messing with a ghost, or at least a supernatural occurrence that may well be explained by a skeptic like Drew herself. If the ghosts do exist, however, we can guarantee they’ll have incredible abs. This is the CW, they have standards.

In other CW trailer news, the network also released a new trailer for the Ruby Rose–starring Batwoman.

326,ENTERTAINMENT,"Busy Tonight, we hardly knew ye. On Thursday night, Busy Philipps bid farewell to her fans with some famous friends, a roast, and a heartfelt eulogy for her canceled E! talk show. As she discussed what she’s learned over the course of the past seven months, Philipps began to cry, but she pushed through and delivered a powerful message (and one last goodbye song!) to her viewers. “If you fee like no one gets you, just keep being yourself,” she said through tears. “You will find someone, or maybe a lot of someones, who do.”

In true Busy Tonight fashion, Philipps sent off the show not with a fizzle, but with a bang. After her guests — Linda Cardellini, Michelle Williams, Krista Miller, Whitney Cummings, and Jennifer Carpenter — had come and gone, Philipps stood alone in the set’s kitchen and reflected on everything the show had accomplished since it first premiered in October 2018. “Here at Busy Tonight, in these few short months we’ve had together, we’ve had a lot of questions,” she said. “But we’ve also learned some things.” Philipps began to get emotional as she recounted some of those lessons, saying, “How you finish something is just as important as how you start it.”

“That giving to people can be so much more rewarding and fun that receiving,” she continued. “That it is okay to be passionate about women’s rights, but also care about face masks and Bradley Cooper’s fucking bang” (as someone who’s watched this show since it first debuted, I have to say that this is perhaps the most apt description of Busy Tonight ever). Philipps then began to cry in earnest, saying, “If you feel like no one gets you, just keep being yourself, dude. And you will find someone, or maybe a lot of someones, who do.”

Philipps ended her eulogy on a more hopeful note. “The most important lesson we learned here is that it is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said. “And the real trick is figuring out what the fuck the marathon is that you’re actually running. And I have to tell you something. Guys, we haven’t even broken a sweat yet.”

Busy Tonight, you will be missed. Here’s hoping that Philipps’ show — the best late night show on television — gets picked up by another network or streaming service. We are all better off with Busy Tonight in our lives.",Busy Philipps Gives an Emotional Eulogy for ‘Busy Tonight’: “Just Keep Being Yourself”
327,ENTERTAINMENT,"""Aquarius"" director Kleber Mendonça Filho returns with a wonderful and demented Western about the perils of rampant modernization.

In some respects, Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “Bacurau” can be seen as a logical continuation of the Brazilian critic-turned-auteur’s two previous features. Much like 2012’s revelatory “Neighboring Sounds,” for example, “Bacurau” is a patient and sprawling portrait of a Brazilian community as it struggles to defend itself against the dark specter of modernity. And much like 2016’s unshakeable “Aquarius,” “Bacurau” hinges on an immovably stubborn woman who refuses to relinquish her place in the world — who won’t allow our blind lust for the future to bury her meaningful ties to the past.

In some respects, however, “Bacurau” marks something of a departure for its director (who shares his credit here with Juliano Dornelles). Whereas “Neighboring Sounds” relies on acoustics to weaponize the 21st century against its characters, this film opts for actual weapons. And while “Aquarius” is a grounded character study about a retired journalist who refuses to sell her Recife apartment to a predatory development company, “Bacurau” is a gloriously demented (and lightly psychedelic) Western that starts in outer space, ends with Udo Kier being hunted by a ghost, and spends the rest of its runtime blending everything from “Seven Samurai” to “Hostel” into a bloody and unapologetic “fuck you” to anyone who thinks that cutting edge technology entitles them to see the world as their own personal slaughterhouse. So… yeah, maybe it’s also a slight change of pace.

Although, that isn’t so apparent at first. When “Bacurau” comes down to Earth, opening in the stars before zooming in on an unlit stretch of land in the isolated flats of northeastern Brazil, the camera focuses its attention on a man and a woman driving along a highway in a water truck. She is Teresa (Barbara Colen), a native of the remote and fictional village that lends the film its title. He is one of the many semi-relevant supporting characters who lend that village a robust sense of life. And the splintered coffins they find strewn about the road should be our first clue that “Bacurau” is steering towards Western territory; in hindsight, it could only be more obvious if a dog ran across the screen with a severed hand in its mouth. But in the moment, given the less fantastical nature of Filho’s previous work, it seems more like a typical arthouse flourish (or maybe the first of several broad swipes at Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro) than a toe-dip into the waters of genre storytelling.

That feeling remains in place for much of the first 30 minutes or so, as Teresa arrives in the tiny but vibrant Bacurau in time to help bury the 94-year-old village elder. Sure, it’s strange that an old man pops a psychotropic substance of some kind into Teresa’s mouth as she walks down the street, but the moment passes so fast that it almost feels subliminal. And the funeral that follows appears normal enough, as it teems with the kind of small town eccentrics that you’d expect to find in the impoverished Brazilian equivalent of Stars Hollow.

“Aquarius” star Sonia Braga is sensational as ever as Domingas, the alcoholic local doctor who loudly calls the deceased a whore. She’s joined by a coterie of oddball personalities who include — but are not limited to — a toothy troubadour, a sweet prostitute, her red-haired pimp, a reformed gangster who can’t figure out what his civilian name should be, and a jolly DJ of sorts who projects YouTube videos on a mobile screen in the center of town and blasts live news alerts through his speaker system for all of Bacurau to hear; the town isn’t big enough to require a radio station.

There are a few subdued hints about the state of things (e.g. the supply routes are closed due to regional violence, the food is rotting, and the lecherous mayor who’s running for re-election is trying to bribe the locals with boxes of free prescription drugs), but the gentle resiliency of this place and its people seem capable of providing enough drama to sustain the rest of the film. The museum in the center of town may not attract many tourists, but it stands as a proud monument to a town with a long memory. And when Teresa’s school teacher father wakes up the next day to find that Bacurau has been wiped off the maps he finds online, it seems less like a glimpse into The Twilight Zone than it does a wry comment on the digital world’s tendency to write over its indigenous people. That’s when a UFO flies into the picture, with Udo Kier not far behind.

It would ruin the fun to reveal how things develop from there, but suffice it to say that the film’s time period — it’s set “a few years from now” — grows harder to ignore as the story opens up and Dornelles and Filho start to bulldoze through the bumper lanes of staid arthouse cinema. Jarring by design, that transition into genre territory can be an awkward one. That’s partially because the sudden uptick in violence that comes with it is shepherded by the arrival of a half-dozen American actors (the most recognizable of whom might be “Support the Girls” bit player Jonny Mars), whose homicidal squabbles smack of an obviousness that’s seldom felt in Filho’s work, and distract from the wealth of wonderful personalities that are waiting for us back in Bacurau.

But the film is able to survive its embarrassment of riches, as Filho quickly adapts to the epic scale of this canvas when it becomes clear that Bacurau is in imminent danger, and that its citizens will have to band together against an invading force in order to reassert their spot on the map and preserve the memories associated with it. Screen wipes, slow fades, and other expressive inflections help ease “Bacurau” out of its starting register, playfully moving the story forward with a wink to the past. The most indelible of Dornelles and Filho’s delirious compositions — hooves stampeding through tungsten light, a museum wall stripped of its exhibits, a dehumanized prostitute in flashy spandex pants cradling her arm like a child as she walks down the town’s dirt road after an unwanted encounter — sustain an arresting friction between the world that Teresa’s people are fighting for, and the world that they’re eventually forced to fight against.

At once both more forceful and more inscrutable than Filho’s previous work, “Bacurau” plunges deeper into midnight territory as its core ideas take hold, its ghosts become literal, and its heroes take up arms. From the very beginning, the village of Bacurau has found a way to straddle the past and the future; they are as modern as they need to be, and no more. Over time, this unmoored and deeply unexpected mash-up assumes the sharp-toothed defiance of Cinema Novo classics like “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman?,” and clarifies why Filho’s movies often feel like veiled threats to those who believe the new world can only be paved over the ruins of the old one. That threat has never been this much fun before, nor have the consequences of ignoring it ever been this gruesome.

“Bacurau” premiered in Competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

329,ENTERTAINMENT,"Like a fine wine, a millennial’s affection for Backstreet Boys has aged extremely well.

Back in 1999, we tweens wore out our Discmans by spinning the group’s pivotal third album “Millennium” — with seminal track and karaoke mainstay “I Want It That Way” and epic fan-appreciation anthem “Larger Than Life” on repeat.

Just a year later, we all laughed along as Blink-182 famously parodied the song’s iconic video in their own video for “All The Small Things,” featuring the men open-shirted and gesturing toward the camera in an airplane hangar. Then, we promptly moved on to genres with a little more suburban street cred — hip-hop, pop-punk, metal, indie and, yes, even emo.

But I’d like to think a majority of us had a small Backstreet Boys-sized hole in our hearts while the band regrouped over the last 20 years — which is why so many late-20s to 30-somethings are going ga-ga over the song “I Want It That Way” again: This time, a “re-imagined” acoustic version.

And adult hearts are aflutter. Some say it almost feels like the first time again.

“I seriously feel like I’m 14 years old listening to #IWantItThatWay on repeat on my CD player. This was such a great surprise,” writes @davitajermone.

“This made me get a bit teary eyed listening for the first time. Brought me back to being in high and listening to the original for the first time. Got the same giddy feeling. ❤️,” adds @aprilrenae.

Some fans (this reporter included) are still waiting to see the remix with Chance the Rapper, inspired by a 2019 Doritos advertisement featuring the song: “Is it bad I was hoping this was the @chancetherapper version from the Doritos commercials? 🤭😂,” writes one wishful thinker.

Nostalgia aside, this song’s rerelease and the band’s rejuvenated fan base come with a pill that’s hard to swallow for us millennials who are rapidly approaching middle age.

331,ENTERTAINMENT,"If you saw A Dog’s Purpose two years ago, then you already have a pretty good idea of what you’re getting into with the movie’s new sequel: the corny dialogue, the contrived plot, the butt-clenching sense of dread …

Oh, what’s that? You thought A Dog’s Purpose was supposed to be an uplifting, family-friendly adventure, not a horror movie? Allow me to refresh your memory, then. The premise of A Dog’s Purpose is that a dog named Bailey is reincarnated over and over, in an endless cycle of suffering, while trying to figure out his reason for living. Inspiring? Perhaps. But this dog also dies so many times over the course of those two hours—from old age, euthanasia, even a gunshot wound—that dog lovers in the audience can only live in fear of what will kill Bailey next.

This vicious cycle continues into A Dog’s Journey, where this time Bailey’s mission is to protect CJ, the perpetually imperiled granddaughter of his most beloved owner from the first movie, Ethan. This proves just as harrowing as the events of the original, so if you’re going to subject yourself to this, you may want to read up on all the ways that Bailey dies (or very nearly dies), so you can be sure you’re up for every agonizing moment.

All the Ways the Dog Dies

1. The first dog, a St. Bernard/Australian shepherd mix named Bailey, is the same dog who survived the end of A Dog’s Purpose. He is euthanized in the barn by a vet after Ethan finds a lump on his belly.

2. The second dog, a beagle named Molly, dies after CJ’s no-good ex-boyfriend runs her car off the road, causing it to flip over. There’s no blood, but Molly doesn’t exactly die instantly, either.

3. The third dog, a droopy mastiff named Big Dog, wanders into a patch of forest to die of old age out of the sight of his owner, Joe.

4. The fourth dog, a Biewer Yorkshire terrier named Max, dies of natural causes surrounded by his loving family, finally having fulfilled his purpose.

1. Bailey (the St. Bernard/Australian shepherd mix) is almost kicked by an ornery horse.

2. A wheezing voice-over warns that when CJ hugs Molly (the beagle), she squeezes a little too tight, which had me worried that the dog might suffocate in her overeager owner’s arms.

3. When teenage CJ is arrested at a party where alcohol is being served, Molly gets sent to doggy jail, and I was paranoid that she might be euthanized as a result.

4. Big Dog (the mastiff) runs into the street to chase after CJ’s car. Thankfully, it’s an empty street.

5. Max (the Yorkie) easily has the most near-death experiences in the movie. The first is when he races into a busy New York City street while chasing CJ and a truck drives right over him—but he’s so small that the vehicle clears him, with Max passing narrowly between the tires.

6. Max rushes into an elevator, where his leash gets caught in the doors as the elevator begins ascending, nearly strangling him.

7. A dog rescue worker tells CJ that Max is scheduled to be euthanized the next day if he’s not adopted.

8. Max is part of a gang of dogs that are so much larger than he is I feared one might step on him.

9. Max develops a mysterious itch on his leg, which, given the earlier belly lump, was ominous enough to make the lady in the seat in front of me say, “Uh-oh.”",Here Are All the Ways the Dog Dies in A Dog’s Journey

• The Tick has been canceled by Amazon after two seasons, but it might not be dead for good
• David Letterman returns to Netflix with season 2 of his talk show
• Freeform’s reboot of Party of Five gets a new promo
• Deathstroke is getting an animated series

The Tick creator Ben Edlund revealed on Twitter today that Amazon has chosen not to renew the show after its second season.

I fully admit I’m part of the problem here. I’m one of those people who thinks The Tick looks like a lot of fun, but haven’t carved out the time to watch it yet. But I’m assuaging some of my guilt by convincing myself that at least I’m helping the cause a little by writing about it and spreading the word to fans who can hopefully be loud enough about their appreciation for the show that another network sees that passion and decides to pick it up.

Every episode of the second season of My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman will be available on Netflix on May 31, 2019. Guests include Kanye West, Ellen Degeneres, Tiffany Haddish, Lewis Hamilton, and Melinda Gates.

The debate continues to rage about the best way for Hollywood to help the women of Georgia, who now find themselves living under an oppressive anti-abortion bill. J.J.

Speaking of the world being a terrible place, here’s the sadly-super-relevant trailer for Freeform’s modern reimagining of the acclaimed 1990s drama series Party of Five.

The TBS series Miracle Workers is officially coming back for a second season. Creator Simon Rich (Man Seeking Woman) based the first season on one of his books, but now that that’s been fully adapted, the anthology series is going in a whole new direction:

Tell your parents to set their DVRs for May 22, 2019, at 8 pm on ABC, because Jimmy Kimmel and Norman Lear are hosting a live, one-night-only recreation of two of Lear’s classic comedies, All in the Family and The Jeffersons. Here’s the breakdown of who’s going to be involved:

Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) will play Dracula on the fourth season of Syfy’s Van Helsing series. One of the show’s executive producers said the actress “will be a fierce and unstoppable Dark One as the battle between good and evil reaches new heights” in the new season, which is set to arrive this fall.

While fans wait to find out what plans Warner Bros. and DC have for comic book villain Deathstroke on the big screen, the character is heading to the streaming world with a new animated series. The untitled show is being developed for CW Seed, The CW’s digital platform, and “would follow Slade as his family is threatened by the murderous villain Jackal and terrorist organization HIVE.” No word yet if Manu Bennett, who played the live-action Deathstroke on The CW show Arrow, will be voicing this animated version of the character or if they’re going to go in a different direction.","TV Bits: Amazon Cancels 'The Tick', 'Deathstroke' Gets An Animated Series, and More –"

• Kim Kardashian West might have just given a major hint about her new baby boy’s name.
• Earlier this week, fans thought it might be “Bear,” but now there’s a different theory.

Kim Kardashian is being incredibly sneaky about her new baby boy’s name, but she just posted a video to her Instagram Stories that could be a total hint.

Basically, the video showed the one and only Saint West holding up a cardboard cutout mask of his Uncle Rob’s face, pretending to be him. He says to Kim, “I’m Uncle Robbie, what’s your name?"" Kim plays along, asking, “What?” And that’s when Saint unmasks himself and giggles hysterically in what is maybe the cutest video of all time.

Under any other circumstance, this would be a totally cute/normal video, but Kim and Kanye West have yet to tell the world what their new baby’s name is, and a few months ago, Kim hinted that it would be Rob.

In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel in April, though, she said it was an option. “Actually, I do have one name. I was truthfully thinking about just naming him Rob, after my brother...but then it’s like, North, Saint, Chicago, Rob. It doesn’t, like, really go. But I really was feeling that or, like, Robert. And my brother approved it, so that’s like our one ‘kind of’ name.”

So if you combine that quote with the video she posted literally while the world is waiting for a bb-name reveal, it seems like it can’t be a coincidence.

But earlier this week, there was a totally different theory going around the internet that Kim and Kanye named the baby Bear. Because Kim posted on social two different times about her baby shower and included the teddy bear emoji, people were absolutely convinced.

336,ENTERTAINMENT,"Adria Petty and Annakim Violette—daughters of the late Tom Petty—filed suit against his widow, Dana York Petty, in a dispute about the singer-songwriter’s catalog and estate, Variety reports.

The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, accuses York Petty of superseding the daughters’ right to “equal participation,” as they claim is in the terms of the trust, when making decisions regarding his catalog. The suit seeks at least $5 million in damages.

Tom Petty died in October 2017 of an accidental drug overdose at the age of 66, which left York Petty as the directing trustee of his trust. In April, both York Petty and Adria filed petitions concerning the handling of his estate, with Dana’s seeking to have the catalog placed in the hands of a professional manager.

In the new lawsuit, the daughters claim to interpret “equal participation” to mean they have a majority vote representing two-thirds of the parties handling decisions for the estate’s assets.

“Tom Petty wanted his music and his legacy to be controlled equally by his daughters, Adria and Annakim, and his wife, Dana. Dana has refused Tom’s express wishes and insisted instead upon misappropriating Tom’s life’s work for her own selfish interests,” Alex Weingarten, an attorney for Petty’s daughters, said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “After countless efforts to resolve this matter amicably and out of court, we could no longer stand idly by and watch Dana disrespect Tom’s wishes, his music and his legacy.”

A rep for Dana York Petty did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. Her attorney, Adam Streisand, gave a statement to Variety. “This misguided and meritless lawsuit sadly demonstrates exactly why Tom Petty designated his wife to be the sole trustee with authority to manage his estate,” Streisand said in the statement. “Dana will not allow destructive nonsense like this to distract her from protecting her husband’s legacy.”

In a recent interview with Rolling Stone that followed the April petitions, Adria said the process has caused her frustration at times.

“We’re trying to figure out how to work with everybody’s advisors and lawyers. We all love each other and we all work pretty great together when we speak directly to each other. It’s been a difficult time. But I’ve seen remarkable changes in my family in the best of ways because of this, and I’ve seen a lot of catharsis and healing in the last 16 months.

“I’m one of four partners [Dana York Petty, Petty’s first wife Jane Benyo Petty, and Jane’s daughters Adria and Annakim], and the convergence of the partnership has yet to begin, but I look forward to being able to do all that,” she continued. “I have no doubt in my mind everything is going to work out. From the bottom of my heart, I love Dana and my family. And I love the Heartbreakers. They’re my family too. It’s just going to take a minute for everyone to catch their breath.”",Tom Petty’s Daughters File Suit Against Widow in Estate Fight
337,ENTERTAINMENT,"The good news: Julie Rosenberg made it all the way to the end of Survivor: Edge of Extinction.

The bad news: Even with the biggest jury pool ever, she could not manage to garner even 1 of the 13 votes.

But for a woman who was pegged by both the host and members of the press before the game as a likely early elimination, making it all the way to day 39 is indeed an accomplishment. We spoke to Julie right after the finale and live reunion to get her thoughts on her journey, her lack of final Tribal votes, whether the jury held her emotions against her, and, naturally, questionable bladder control.

ENTERTAINMENT WEKELY: This was clearly not the result you wanted, as you got shut out in the final voting, but congratulations on making it all 39 days. I hope you haven’t lost sight that that is a major accomplishment.

 JULIE ROSENBERG: Thank you, no, I’m so proud of how I did. To be able to have that whole experience and be there the entire 39 days was unbelievable for me. And I’m pretty realistic about my game, I knew going into that final Tribal that I wasn’t going to get the majority of the votes, and I even thought I probably won’t get any and that’s okay with me. I have no regrets, I loved every minute of the game out there, and it is what it is, and I’m just super happy and supper proud. The reason I went out there was to push myself, to totally be out of my element, out of my comfort zone, and it’s exactly what I did, and I made it. I made it to the end, and I’m happy with it.

Let’s get into some of the things we just saw on the finale. First off, there’s the situation where Chris is tutoring you and Gavin on making fire, although he’s planning to take on Rick himself. Let’s say he had put you against Rick in fire. How do you think you would’ve done?

 You know, it’s so interesting, because that whole day I really did practice. You saw me and Gavin side-by-side together, practicing, and we were giving each other tips and suggestions, and I was helping him, and he was helping me, and of course Chris sat there and gave us tips and he said what to do, which was very helpful.

I think Chris is amazing at making fire, and I was pretty sure the entire day, he’s not putting me in that challenge. I had a feeling he would go put himself in the challenge, but if he had put me in, or if I happened to be in it in any other different situation, at the end of that day, I was pretty confident with myself. I’m not saying that I could’ve done it the fastest. I hadn’t seen how Rick was making fire, but I was confident. I think I could’ve done it.

Let’s ask the what if question, which I imagine you probably have asked yourself over the past 10 months. If he had put you in there, and you had beaten Rick Devens at fire, had that big hero moment, put that big notch on your belt, and then taking that notch off of Chris’ belt who needs those notches because he’s only played a few days of the game, do you think, then, you maybe possibly win Survivor?

 I don’t know if it would’ve influenced the outcome. I do think that it would’ve helped me in some way, to prove for myself, to earn my spot in the final three. When Chris first gave me the necklace, I’m happy. I’m thrilled, I’m in the final three, but that’s not the way I wanted to do it, and I felt like I wanted to chuck that necklace in the fire right then and there, and be like, “No, I’m not taking it.”

But it is what it is, and even if I had won fire and still sat there with those two guys in the final three, I don’t think I would’ve won. At that point, I knew what my game was, and I’m a very subtle player, and I was very emotional, and I know the jury did not reward those types of players. And looking back, there’s so many things I could’ve done differently. I could’ve been way more aggressive in my game, but I did the best that I could out there. I was just surviving. That’s what this is, it’s Survivor. I survived out there, and maybe if you ever see me again, you’ll see Julie 2.0.

Well, this was a big discussion at that final Tribal, talking about your emotions which came to the forefront a few times, most famously when Julia was voted out. Do you think the jury held that stuff against you?

 I do. I do now, I didn’t feel like it at the time. The truth is I really just broke down, and I had been having a rough few days leading up to that Tribal. It wasn’t even about the Eric blindside at the Tribal before, and feeling on the outs or whatever with my original group. I was in pure starvation mode at that point. I think I was the one that had gone the longest without food since the merge. I didn’t opt out for pizza in that immunity challenge, so I was dragging like I have never seen, and once that physical fatigue and starvation set in so badly, then the emotional stuff started and I couldn’t stop crying and thinking about my kids. It was just my lowest of lows in that game, and it was like a perfect storm of all these things that happened that led up to that night.

Although I have to say, I thought I had to do something to shake things up, but I don’t have the numbers. I did tell Rick and David right before Tribal, I wish I could beat Julia, I feel like she’s running things, and I want to get her out. And so mission accomplished. It actually happened, and I felt like I was the catalyst and the trigger for it. In the end though, giving in that way in front of the jury obviously didn’t bring me any votes.

What did you think about where we saw Rick call you out a little bit, saying that he had watched your back, and tried to help you and do all this and you had not done the same for him? What’d you make of that whole speech?

 I mean, you know, it’s hard. I truly did want to form a connection with him, and some alliance with him at the merge. I knew he had kids. I felt like I could connect with him, and I knew that our Kama alliance was gonna implode at some point, and that it would break so, like, start thinking about where I was going to position myself. I just didn’t think it was gonna happen as soon as it did.

I really did want to work with Rick. I really did talk to him a lot, with Ron and David about making a move and being the final four, but he became such a huge threat. We all saw how the jury was reacting to him, the minute we’d walk into Tribal, I was like, they did him a disservice, because they were so reactive with their facial expressions and their cheers.

Every time he came in wearing the necklace, or he’d play an idol, and we’re all there thinking, “No one can sit next to this guy.” So I would say to Rick, “Listen, I’m really sorry, but no one can beat you at the end, we’re all seeing that, so don’t hold this against me. I love you as a person, but I’d be stupid to keep you in the game knowing I cannot beat you.” So, in the end, I think he understood. We’re really good friends now, there’s no hard feelings. I mean, who knows.

All right, final question. When are we meeting up in New York for lunch?

 Tomorrow. I’m going back tomorrow, but you gotta stop with these comments about me with my bladder control.

You’re to blame for that! They’re your comments. They’re literally your comments.

 That is true, but you know, they were joking comments on the show. I didn’t realize it was going to become a running theme. I wasn’t thinking about it, it is an expression, everyone says “Oh my god, I’m so nervous, I’m gonna pee in my pants.” You haven’t said that? Tell me you haven’t said that.

Yes, but you told me how you literally peed your pants, and then you also mentioned peeing in Central Park.

 It wasn’t my pants. I was naked at the time.

That’s true.

 But you know, look, I’m sorry, but have you had two back-to-back pregnancies a year apart, and gained 50 pounds for each? Do you know what that’s like? It’s not easy. I’m gonna leave it at that.

338,ENTERTAINMENT,"Chris Jericho sounds pretty pumped to be part of a pro wrestling promotional war again.

In the 90s, Jericho is one of the few wrestlers to work on both WCW’s Monday Nitro as well as WWF’s Monday Night Raw during each program’s ratings heyday. Nearly 20 years later Jericho is still an active competitor, and count him in as one of the many people excited to watch AEW and WWE go against one another.

In a new interview with TV Insider, Jericho was asked about AEW’s impact on the pro wrestling business and if WWE is watching what the upstart promotion is doing.

“I’m not surprised. I will say this…everyone in WWE owes Chris Jericho a thank you because the moment I signed with AEW, it became legit. That’s when everyone started getting these huge raises to not go. It was very similar to what happened to Bobby Hull in the early 1970s when he signed with the WHA (World Hockey Association) for a million dollars. Every other player got a huge raise to not jump with him. My dad [Ted Irvine] went from a $35,000 to a $100,000 a year because they didn’t want him going to the WHA. It’s the same thing for Vince [McMahon] is doing with WWE.”

Shocking how Jericho found a way to thank himself during that answer. Never change Y2J.

Jericho also added a note about enjoying the thrill of competition.

“This is a war. Even if you don’t want it to be, it just is. There hasn’t been any competition for WWE on a national basis for 20 years or more. I think this is something they didn’t really want, but it’s great for the fans and great for the guys. I think in the long run it’s going to make a difference because it gives people a choice. And it’s always good to have a choice.”

Like in any industry, competition is usually good for the workers and the end product.

With a major cable television deal to call their own, whether you love or loathe them, AEW is off to a great start. Considering they have a grand total of zero live events or pay-per-views under their belt, AEW will probably not be able to go heads up with WWE anytime soon, but even the small threat of competition should in theory be better for the wrestling business as a whole.

In the end, does anyone suffer if AEW forces WWE to get their stuff together and improve the product fans watch week in and week out?

339,ENTERTAINMENT,"Bad Gal RiRi knows the power of an image.



The perennial cover girl, beauty mogul and newly-minted head of her own fashion label chose to focus her Instagram followers’ sights on one particularly compelling image: the blindingly beige visage of all the white men responsible for passing America’s most restrictive abortion bill to date.

In a post that went up Thursday morning, Rihanna shared a collage of the Alabama’s mostly Republican Senate, which this week passed a bill effectively making abortion illegal in the state, even in cases of rape and incest.

The collage is a veritable E. coli buffet of dishwasher-cooked chicken, served alongside a smattering of expired bronzer and terrible haircuts:

“These are the idiots making decisions for WOMEN in America,” Rihanna wrote. And lest you think our righteous Rih-presentative had it out for male politicians alone, note Rihanna kept that same energy for one very special white woman, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who signed the bill into law.

“SHAME ON YOU!!!!” she added, with all-caps bass in her voice.

The new bill is designed to be so restrictive it would invite legal challenges, thus paving its way to land, eventually, at the Supreme Court, which currently has a conservative majority. The legislation classifies abortion as a felony offense, with doctors or medical providers convicted of performing these procedures eligible for prison sentences up to 99 years.

Joining Rihanna in condemning Alabama’s bill were singer John Legend, Kerry Washington, and director and producer Ava DuVernay, who tweeted yesterday that the abortion bill was “a warning” to everyone.

“It’s Alabama and abortion today. It’s you and your rights tomorrow,” she wrote. “Your silence will not save you. So speak up.”","Rihanna Wants You to Remember the Pasty, Lipless Idiots Responsible for Alabama's Terrible Abortion Law"

344,ENTERTAINMENT,"Sarah Jessica Parker reports that the National Enquirer sends her a horrible email every year before her wedding anniversary without fail.

The actress took to Instagram to post an image of the email she receives from the tabloid and a request for comment. Understandably frustrated, Parker included a comment along with the post. “Just like clockwork.

Over a decade of the same untrue, disgraceful nonsense,” she wrote. 

“As usual, days ahead of our anniversary on May 19th, The National Enquirer is making its annual best effort to fabricate and undermine, this time a blissful 4 days with my husband in London.”

She continued by saying not only is the couple not fighting, but she and the children are also very proud of Broderick. Parker has spoken about her husband in the past and lovingly had this amazing description of what she loved most about him.

The couple spoke to The New York Times in 1996 when they were still dating. She was clearly swooning as the two appeared in “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” Audience members could sense the couple’s chemistry often referring to them as being adorable on stage.

Broderick and Parker said their romance took time to heat up. “My memory is that literally months passed when I didn’t ask her for a date,” Broderick said.

“Your memory is correct,” Parker said recalling the exact day when they finally started dating. “Then he left a very charming, very self-effacing message on the machine. You know, ‘Hi, it’s Matthew Broderick.’ You had to use your last name.”

Broderick remembers the two went to a movie. “And I still remember very clearly seeing her walk down the street toward the movie theater…it’s very unique, because I wouldn’t remember most people the first time I saw them come down the street. [But] I remember it as clear as day.”

This is what struck her

Parker told the Los Angeles Times in 1996 what really struck her about Broderick. “He’s probably the funniest fellow I’ve met in my whole life,” she said, E News recounts. “He’s so bright, so handsome, I think he’s the most handsome man I’ve seen in my life. And he inspires me. I’m mad for him, totally.”

At the time the couple was working together on stage. “I’m so nervous acting opposite him,” she said. “I don’t know how we’re going to manage this without laughing hysterically at each other. We do not discuss it. I don’t even want to rehearse—I’m going to go onstage with a big blinder on my head—I don’t know what I’m thinking.”

Through the years the couple, like most couples, have had their ups and downs. But Parker said she still fiercely loves her husband. “Relationships are hard,” she remarked.. “I always felt that I wanted to invest more. I love him, and I think he’s brilliant. I’m sure I annoy him. He annoys me sometimes. I’m enormously proud of the person he is. I think the longer you can last, the more invested you just are.”

And this may be one thing that makes their relationship work

Unlike most couples, actors often need to travel for long periods of time. While that may tear some apart, Parker told Sophia Amoruso’s Girlboss Radio on her podcast that was what kept the relationship going.

“I know this sounds nuts, but we have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,” she said E News reports. “His work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that that’s been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share in a way… anytime that any relationship is hard, it’s the point in which you’re deciding, is this worth the investment getting through whatever that thing is?”",Sarah Jessica Parker Describes Matthew Broderick in This Sweet Way

349,ENTERTAINMENT,"The estranged wife of tragic Jeremy Kyle guest Steve Dymond launched a blistering attack on her former partner after hearing of his death.

Dianne Healing is believed to have still been legally married to Dymond, 63, at the time of his death, which came days after he filmed his appearance on The Jeremy Kyle Show.

He's said to have taken his own life after failing a lie detector test which he'd hoped would prove he hadn't cheated on his fiancee.

It has now emerged that Steve was reportedly still married to Healing, 48, who went online to slam her ex.

She posted allegations he'd been abusive to her and her family and she'd been ""terrified"" of him.

According to Mail Online , she posted a reference to his death, writing: ""I’m a widow folks but it isn’t official yet!

""I hope you burn in hell for what you put my family through Steve Dymond.

""This is how I find out my husband is dead? Not that I care. He was a vile man.""

Healing, who married Dymond in 2004 after nine months of dating, told the publication: ""I have hardly left my house in the last 15 years because of this man.

""I am quite angry he has been portrayed this way.

""I don’t get it. I have been through a lot, me and my family. My daughters and I have been distraught over him.""

She added: ""We have spent the last 15 years terrified of him. We are relieved he is dead.""

Steve took part in The Jeremy Kyle Show to prove he hadn't cheated on on-off fiancée Jane Callaghan.

But he failed the lie detector test, allegedly prompting host Jeremy to""'rip in to him'"" and for Jane to end things for good.

Just days later he was found dead in his rented bedroom surrounded by letters written to loved ones.

According to his landlady Shelly, 55, who made the grim discovery, he was ""sobbing and distraught"" when he returned from filming on May 2.

ITV have since cancelled the show with immediate effect,

350,SCIENCE,"After New Horizons streaked past Pluto in 2015, its main task was over, but it still had work to do. On New Year’s Day of 2019 , it made a flyby of another, even more distant object named 2014 MU, more commonly called Ultima Thule. Since then, the spacecraft has been slowly but steadily sending streams of information back across the increasingly vast gulf of space between it and Earth.From that information, scientists now know that the snowman-shaped space rock formed from a gentle collision of two bodies, that astronomers now refer to as Ultima and Thule. In general, Ultima Thule seems to have had a calm history, with little variation across its surface, leading astronomers to rule out more violent collisions that would lead to a more patchwork appearance. These and other details were revealed Thursday in a study led by Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute and published in the journal Science Ultima Thule’s calm history falls neatly into place with other recent observations. There are a whole herd of spacecraft taking data on oddball space rocks, and where those rocks orbit seems to tell astronomers a great deal about what to expect from their histories.For objects in the asteroid belt and elsewhere in the middle of the solar system, it’s common to see a history of violence. Due to their closer tracks to the Sun, these objects move faster, and collide more violently. Objects often break apart into smaller pieces on collision, instead of merging together, and many of the objects currently under investigation show signs of once being part of larger bodies . They’re also more active right now, when more direct exposure to sunlight can cause surprising activity on their surfaces But for objects in the Kuiper Belt around Pluto and beyond, astronomers see evidence of a more peaceful existence. Because these objects orbit so far from the Sun, their orbital speeds are slower (this is a basic tenant of Kepler’s laws). Also, the solar system is generally less crowded as you look farther out from the Sun. So objects collide less often, and at slower speeds, resulting in less small debris. Pluto showed this phenomenon in its relative lack of impact scars . And now Ultima Thule backs up the same ideas.While the first images New Horizons sent back showed apparently distinct regions on Ultima Thule, more detailed investigations show little variance in color or composition, again pointing to a history lacking sharp or recent changes. And New Horizons found no signs of dust, moons, or rings around Ultima Thule, another sign that it has spent much of its history alone and undisturbed.Ultima Thule did offer one big surprise. Rather than a fully round snowman, the two pieces of the asteroid appear to be flattened, more like two pancakes that were poured too closely in the pan and grew together. Since most space rocks are at least vaguely spherical, the flattened nature of Ultima Thule perplexes astronomers. So far, it’s not clear what caused the flattening.Astronomers often look to asteroids as the building blocks of the solar system, since they’ve undergone far fewer changes than the material that was long ago incorporated into large, complex bodies like planets and their often active moons. The rest of the New Horizons data won’t finish downloading to Earth until next year, when astronomers can finish mining Ultima Thule’s secrets. But for those researchers looking for a pristine space rock, Ultima Thule may be exactly the right target.","New Horizons reveals Ultima Thule's quiet, lonesome past"
351,SCIENCE,"Of course, Saturday's moon won't actually be blue. And the reason for the name is a little confusing.

A blue moon is the second of two full moons in a month -- but it can also be the third of four full moons during a single season. In this case, it's the third of four full moons this spring. These don't occur as often as two full moons in a month.

""The name 'Blue Moon' has nothing to do with the color of the Moon,"" Gianluca Masi, astrophysicist and director of the Virtual Telescope Project in Rome, wrote in an email. ""Every two to three years we have 13 full Moons within a year. This way, we can have four full Moons during a given season or two full Moons in a given month.""

This is the last seasonal blue moon until August 2021.

Very rarely, both types of blue moons happen in one year; this will occur in 2048, including a monthly blue moon in January and a seasonal one in August. Sometimes, the moon can actually appear blue during certain sky conditions, but it can't be predicted. So, on Saturday, enjoy the sight of the beautiful moon with some appreciation for what it means. And to see a dramatic full moon over the Rome skyline, watch the live stream provided by the Virtual Telescope Project.",Rare 'blue flower moon' will appear in Saturday night's sky
352,SCIENCE,"NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine is currently the public face of the agency’s newly named lunar initiative, Artemis, which aims to put the first woman on the surface of the Moon by 2024. On Monday, he revealed that NASA wants an extra $1.6 billion for next year to accelerate the project, but questions still remain about the ultimate cost of the program and the nitty-gritty details on how NASA astronauts will actually get to the lunar surface.

NASA already has an overall outline for how this initiative will take shape, but now Bridenstine has the daunting task of securing funds to jump-start the ambitious project. The agency plans to build a space station called the Gateway in orbit around the Moon, which will serve as an outpost for astronauts. NASA has also been developing a rocket called the SLS and a crew capsule called Orion, which, together, will take astronauts to this new lunar station. From there, humans will ride in a lander from the Gateway to the lunar surface.

Bridenstine has the daunting task of securing funds to jump-start the ambitious project

All of those moving pieces mean that a lot of new hardware needs to be developed and tested over the next five years, and some in-space assembly is definitely required. This week, The Verge spoke with Bridenstine by phone and email to learn more about the new Artemis program and what it’s going to take to convince Congress to add another $1.6 billion to NASA’s coffers.

This interview was edited lightly for length and clarity.

One thing a lot of people noticed is that the request is kind of low. It’s definitely not $8 billion like some people thought, and it’s also low when you compare it to the increases that Apollo got back in the ‘60s and ‘70s. What do you say to those who think it’s not high enough?

We have to remember that we already have SLS, Orion, and the European Service Module well underway. Those are three of the biggest components to getting humans to the Moon, and we’re on the brink of being ready with those programs. When we talk about what we need, we’ve got to get the Gateway developed, and we need to get the landing systems developed.

That’s really what we’re focused on now. If you look at a normal development project, it follows a bell curve. So, as you identified correctly, the first year is pretty low. We’re turning to commercial industry to provide us with their thoughts on how to go from the Gateway down to the surface of the Moon. We are in essence buying a service. Commercial industry is going to provide a service for American astronauts to go from the Gateway down to the surface of the Moon.

We’re looking for our industry partners to make their own investments into the lander. We expect them to invest in it with a purpose of having customers that are not NASA. They could have customers that would be international. They could have customers that would be commercial industry customers. So we’re looking for our partners to invest their own money.

What the $1 billion gets us is a strong start out of the gate to begin the development with money for key milestones. And then we will be looking for additional resources in 2021. Like I said, it follows a bell curve. So 2021 will be a little bit more, 2022 will be more than that, and then it’ll start coming back down.

Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) and Kendra Horn (D-OK) have already expressed their early sentiments about this, and they’ve both talked about their concern over the fact that there’s no full budget for the years ahead. So why not reveal the full five-year budget now?

Well, we’re doing this in a way that’s never been done before. Again, we are asking industry to invest in it, and we want to look at what their ideas are before we make bigger decisions. There are proposals that only require two elements to get from the Gateway down to the surface of the Moon and then back to the Gateway: a descent module and an ascent module. There are other ideas that utilize three elements that would include a transfer vehicle.

“we’re doing this in a way that’s never been done before.”

So there’s different concepts, different ideas out there. Different companies are able to invest their own money at different levels. And so, because of how we’re moving forward, it’s difficult for us to be able to assess what all the options are right now. But we are anxiously anticipating that we’re going to get a lot of great ideas, and we will be able to make assessments as to what the 2021 budget will look like based on the ideas that come in.

On Monday, you said it was tough to get people on the phone about the new budget amendment. Have you been able to talk to more lawmakers since the release, and do you have more details on their reactions?

Absolutely. I testified in the Senate just a few days ago, and it was very positive. People are excited about the Moon. Last night, Senator [Jerry] Moran, who is the chairman of the CJS Appropriations Committee in the Senate — that’s the key committee that funds NASA — sent out a tweet that very specifically said:

“Our greatest achievements remain ahead of us. And as the chief appropriator for NASA, I will work with the President of the United States, the Vice President and Jim Bridenstine, to make certain NASA has the resources to land the first woman on the Moon and build lasting infrastructure to support missions to Mars and beyond.”

I was not anticipating that. I was excited to see it, and I immediately retweeted it.

And I will say, talking to Senators on the other side of the aisle, I think there’s broad agreement that this is something that is very exciting that people are interested in. I’ve had a number of Senators and House members ask me specifically: Is this enough? Do you have everything you need on this? And for the year 2020, the answer is yes. So the concern I think from a lot of the folks on the other side of the aisle is, is this everything you need?

I think there’s good support here on both sides of the aisle.

Also on Monday, you mentioned you did not know where the money was coming from within the federal budget, but it’s now been revealed to be from the Pell Grant surplus like we suspected. Do you have any concerns about this in terms of making it harder to sell the mission to Congress?

The way I look at it is: this is now part of the overall budget request. And when you look at the entirety of the budget request, there are accounts that go up and there are accounts that go down. My only direction was to tell them what we thought it would take to get a good start in the year 2020 for a 2024 Moon landing.

“what accounts go up and what accounts go down is above my pay grade.”

We gave them those numbers. They delivered those numbers. And what accounts go up and what accounts go down is above my pay grade and outside of my control. I will certainly say that NASA has what it needs, and it’s up to the House and the Senate how they want to fund it. And whatever they choose to do, we will follow the law.

You mentioned that this budget doesn’t draw from within NASA, but there is language within the budget amendment that would give the administrator authority to do so. I’d love some clarity on that.

The President’s budget amendment does not rely on any offsets within existing NASA programs to enable US astronauts to return to the Moon by 2024, and I have stated publicly that I have no intent of redirecting funding from other NASA programs, including science, in support of the human lunar return effort. The intent of the proposed transfer language is to provide the NASA administrator maximum flexibility, within the funds allocated, in support of establishing a US strategic presence on the Moon in the most effective and efficient way possible. The language is not intended to enable transfer of other funds within the agency to the lunar effort.

NASA will work with the committees on appropriation to ensure that this transfer authority is clearly limited to overall funding for the lunar effort.

Let’s talk about the actual mission. One thing Rep. Horn told me was that she wants more details about the plan. We know the basics: SLS will take Orion to the Gateway, and from there, people will travel in a lander to the Moon. But do you have a more detailed road map of all the launches and tests that need to be done between now and then, or is that still in the works?

Certainly, you’ve identified a number of the pieces, and all of those pieces need to be tested. As far as the launches go, we have to get the first elements of the Gateway launched: the Power and Propulsion Element and what we call the Utilization Module, which is a very small habitat. Each one of those pieces will be launched commercially, so there’s two launches.

And then we need to aggregate the lander at the Gateway. And that lander could either have two or three pieces. And we will be looking at proposals from industry on that to make assessments as to what’s the best approach. We are certainly working through a more detailed analysis.

Do you have an understanding of the amount of launches or missions you’re going to need that include launching the Gateway elements, including launching test flights for Orion, landers, etc.?

We have SLS, which is going to launch EM-1. We’re now going to call it Artemis 1. But Artemis 1 is going to be an uncrewed launch around the Moon. Artemis 2 is going to be a crewed launch around the Moon. Artemis 3 is going to carry the next humans that land on the Moon. Each one of those launches is an SLS rocket with an Orion crew capsule and a European Service Module.

Now, for Artemis 3 that carries our crew to the Gateway, we need to have the crew have access to a lander. So, that means that at Gateway we’re going to have the Power and Propulsion Element, which will be launched commercially, the Utilization Module, which will be launched commercially, and then we’ll have a lander there. And there’s either two or three elements to the lander depending on what industry — how they want to solve the challenge of getting from the Gateway down to the surface of the Moon. And if there’s two elements, there will be two commercial launches. If there’s three elements, there will probably be three commercial launches.

Just based on my quick math, it sounds like about seven to eight launches is what you’re targeting.

Gateway is two elements, that’s two launches. You have a lander — we’ll say that there’s three launches for the lander, so there’s five. And in fact, we want to have two unique solutions for the lander, so there’s six, seven, and eight. And then you’ve got three SLS launches, so that’s nine, 10, and 11. So, up to 11 launches.

Now a lot of this relies on architecture that’s been in development for about a decade, such as SLS and Orion, and like you said, the programs have suffered from setbacks and delays. Meanwhile, Vice President Pence has talked about urgency and that if our current contractors can’t cut it, we’ll get new contractors. What happens if these programs are delayed again, and is more money enough to keep them on schedule?

I think we have what we need for now. The most probable path to enabling the next man and the first woman on the surface of the Moon in 2024 is to move forward as quickly as possible with SLS and Orion. And so we think that this is achievable. We have to make sure that there are no errors and no setbacks.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on recent pitches that have been made publicly for human-rated lunar landers. Lockheed made a pitch in April, and then I’m sure you saw Jeff Bezos unveiled Blue Moon last week. What do you think of those proposals and could they be incorporated into the NASA plan?

We are very excited about them. We want to have two very dissimilar landing capabilities, so that if one of them has a setback, the other one can go forward. And there are others beyond the two that you just mentioned that are underway. Each one of these represents an opportunity for NASA to get unique perspectives from some very capable service providers, and we look forward to assessing and analyzing what they’re planning to do, and how much they believe it’s going to cost, and how much they’re willing to invest in the program.

Obviously the deadline is very close. Have you started thinking about a training plan for astronauts and what that would entail?

Absolutely. The training plan is underway. We have a very qualified and diverse astronaut corps with lots of experience on the International Space Station. We have not selected the cadre that will be that first crew that goes in 2022 around the Moon and then in 2024 to the Gateway and then onto the surface. We have not selected what that cadre looks like, but we are very confident we have the right people. And we look forward to getting them ready.

There’s been a lot of talk about spacesuits and how they may not be ready. You have emphasized that they will be, but I’d love some more details about them. I know there’s some money already in this year’s request, but do you plan on giving out new contracts soon or using existing contracts?

Here’s the thing: We know what it takes to build a space suit. It’s a priority for us. It’s not an easy thing to achieve. But certainly, we’re not going to go to the Moon without spacesuits so we’re working through that right now.

Artemis is all about putting women on the Moon. Will she be the one to make the first step on the Moon?

The direction that we have right now is that the next man and the first woman will be Americans, and that we will land on the south pole of the Moon in 2024. Beyond that we’ve not made any specific decisions, but I will tell you it’s something that we’re all interested in, and I think there’s a lot of young ladies all across the country, and in fact all around the world, that are wondering who that first woman is going to be.

Given everything we’ve talked about, do you have one big concern about making this plan a reality? What are the biggest challenges for you guys and how do you plan to overcome those hurdles?

You have identified the biggest risk, which is political. And that’s why we’re not on the Moon right now. It’s, in fact, why we’re not on Mars right now. We go back to 1972, it was the last time we had a person on the surface of the Moon. And there have been many efforts since 1972 to return to the Moon, and they have all failed. And they have not failed because of NASA; they have not failed because of the technological capabilities of this agency. They have failed because of the whimsical budgets that come from politicians.

“it’s so important to accelerate this program.”

So that’s one of the reasons it’s so important to accelerate this program. As the program goes longer and longer, what happens is priorities change, budgets change, administrations change, and each one of these things result in additional political risk.

We’ve been through this before. If we want to have success we have to retire the political risk, which means we need to accelerate the plan to get to the Moon, and we need strong bipartisan consensus that this is the right thing to do for our country. I think we’re there. I think there’s a lot of people that understand that this is a unique opportunity that we need to seize upon.",NASA administrator on new Moon plan: ‘We’re doing this in a way that’s never been done before’
353,SCIENCE,"There is now believed to be an astonishing 170 million pieces of junk floating in Earth’s upper atmosphere, but only 22,000 are being tracked. Some 7,000 tonnes of space junk circle our planet, as defunct satellites, junk from rockets and other metals and rocks build up close to Earth. Experts have previously warned that as space debris increases, it will make it harder for rocket’s to escape Earth’s orbit out of fear of colliding with an object, known as the ‘Klesser syndrome’.

Now, an expert has singled out Elon Musk and his SpaceX firm, with the company planning on sending 60 satellites into orbit as part of Starlink – a project which will hopefully see internet beamed from space, thus making it more accessible for everyone. The SpaceX Starlink plan is an attempt to bring high-speed internet to anyone around the world. The satellites will centre using a low earth orbit to link to ground terminals on Earth to provide internet connection. These low orbit satellites are between 99 to 1,200 miles from Earth instead of the traditional 22,000 miles for geostationary satellites

When asked about SpaceX’s launches, Dr Stijn Lemmens told Scientific American: “The worst case is: You launch all your satellites, you go bankrupt, and they all stay there. “Then you have thousands of new satellites without a plan of getting them out of there. And you would have a Kessler-type of syndrome.” Space debris can be detrimental to space travel and as Earth’s low orbit continues to become more congested, experts including those at NASA have warned of its perils.

Nicholas Johnson, the chief scientist for Orbital Debris, said: “Any of these debris has the potential for seriously disrupting or terminating the mission of operational spacecraft in low Earth orbit. “This satellite breakup represents the most prolific and serious fragmentation in the course of 50 years of space operations.” Not only does it pose a threat to space travel, but technologies such as mobile phones, television, GPS and weather related services also rely on satellites, so a cataclysmic series of crashes could pose a threat to our already over-reliance for satellites.",SpaceX News: Elon Musk’s firm could congest orbit and ‘TRAP HUMANITY on Earth’

For the second consecutive day, SpaceX called off a Falcon 9 launch attempt at Cape Canaveral on Thursday evening, this time to complete a software update on the first 60 satellites for the company’s Starlink network to provide high-speed Internet service from orbit.

SpaceX cancelled Thursday night’s launch attempt, which was set for 10:30 p.m. EDT (0230 GMT Friday), around three hours before the opening of the launch window.

In a tweet, the company said it was “standing down to update satellite software and triple-check everything again.”

The payload awaiting launch on the Falcon 9 rocket consists of 60 flat-panel satellites to begin building out SpaceX’s Starlink network, a fleet that could number thousands of small spacecraft in the coming years, providing broadband connectivity to consumers around the world.

SpaceX did not set a new launch date for the mission, the first Falcon 9 launch dedicated to the Starlink project.

“Always want to do everything we can on the ground to maximize mission success, next launch opportunity in about a week,” SpaceX tweeted.

The 60 satellites aboard the Falcon 9 were built in a new SpaceX factory in Redmond, Washington. The spacecraft are equipped with high-power phased array antennas to broadcast Internet signals and krypton ion thrusters for propulsion.

The Falcon 9 rocket will release the satellites, which each weigh about 500 pounds (227 kilograms), into orbit around an hour after liftoff from Cape Canaveral.

The 60 satellites will separate from the Falcon 9’s upper stage in a unique fashion, according to Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO.

“It will be a little bit different looking deployment than people are used to,” Musk told reporters Wednesday in a conference call. “It’s going to be a very slow deployment where we rotate the stage, and each of the satellites on the stack has a slightly different amount of rotational inertia.

“So there’s not actually a spring-based or specific deployment mechanism per satellite,” he said. The satellites will kind of be deployed, it’s almost like spreading a deck of cards on a table. This will be kind of weird compared to normal satellite deployments.”

Multi-payload dispensers launched atop rockets typically release satellites in pairs, or one at a time, with a physical separation mechanism, such as a spring or pyrotechnic bolts.

SpaceX’s webcast will show the deployment through the view of a camera mounted on the rocket’s upper stage.

“There actually may be a small amount of contact between the satellites, but it’s very, very slow, and the satellites are designed to handle it,” Musk said. “But we wanted to avoid having 60 different deployment mechanisms for the satellites. We expect them to turn on shortly after deployment. They’ll start warming up the ion drive and go through a bunch of health checks.”

The 60 Starlink satellites are based on a new design conceived by SpaceX engineers. They are lighter and use a different separation scheme than two prototype Starlink satellites SpaceX launched last year.

“We should know if they’re in good shape probably about two or three hours after deployment, so three or four hours after launch,” he said.

The Falcon 9 launch will aim to release the Starlink satellites around 273 miles (440 kilometers) above Earth, and the spacecraft’s own thrusters will raise their orbits to 341 miles (550 kilometers) to begin technology demonstration trials.

“This is one of the hardest engineering projects I’ve ever seen done, and it’s been executed really well,” Musk said. “There is a lot of new technology here, and it’s possible that some of these satellites may not work, and in fact a small possibility that all the satellites will not work.

“We don’t want to count anything until it’s hatched, but these are, I think, a great design and we’ve done everything we can to maximize the probability of success,” he said.

Past initiatives to create an expansive communications satellite network in low Earth orbit, a regime a few hundred miles above Earth, have met technical and financial headwinds. Traditional communications satellites fly in higher geostationary orbits more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) above the equator, with a single spacecraft covering a wide geographic region.

In lower orbits, the Starlink satellites will bounce signals from user-to-user via an intricate web of radio connections through ground stations, and eventually through inter-satellite laser cross-links.

“The goal of the Starlink system is to provide high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, ideally throughout the world provided we get regulatory approval, and this would provide connectivity to people that don’t have any connectivity today, or where it’s extremely expensive and unreliable as well as providing options for people who may have connectivity today in developed areas of the world but it’s very expensive,” Musk said. “This will provide a competitive option for them.”

Starlink is one of several companies working on constellations of small broadband satellites in low Earth orbit. OneWeb launched its first six satellites in February, with plans to send hundreds more into orbit over the next two years, and Amazon says it plans to build a network consisting of thousands of satellites for Internet service.

“There’s a lot of fundamental goodness about Starlink,” he said. “We just want to make sure the appropriate caveats are there. There’s a lot of technology, this is very hard, and quite frankly in the past, the success of low-Earth orbit communications constellations, I believe none have successfully gone into operation without going bankrupt.”

SpaceX has secured regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission for nearly 12,000 Starlink satellites broadcasting in Ku-band, Ka-band and V-band frequencies, with groups of spacecraft positioned at different altitudes in low Earth orbit. But the early focus is on launching hundreds of the satellites to establish a network that covers most of the world’s population.

“It’s important to distinguish between initial operational capability, which is around the 400-satellite level, and then significant operational capability is around 800-satellite level, and thereafter, it’s about adding more and more satellites and more orbital planes of satellites as we get more usage of the system and we get bandwidth constrained,” Musk said. “One does not need anywhere near 10,000 satellites to be effective. … We’ll start selling service initial around the 400th satellite launch and then make sure our production and launch of satellites stays ahead of user demand.”

After the first Starlink launch, SpaceX plans between two and six additional Starlink missions later this year to begin building out the first phase of the network in orbit 341 miles above Earth, according to Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president and chief operating officer.

“This next batch of satellites will really be a demonstration set for us to see the deployment scheme and start pulling our network together,” Shotwell said at an industry conference last week.",SpaceX postpones Starlink launch to update satellite software – Spaceflight Now
355,SCIENCE,"Have you been paying attention to the international moon race going on right now? I'd somehow missed the fact that countries ranging from India and Israel to China and Japan all have moon missions underway or imminent.

Yep, Google Israel's privately funded Beresheet mission, India's Chandrayaan-2 (complete with lunar rover), and China's Chang'e-4. That one's Yutu-2 rover is currently prospecting on the back side of the moon in search of a helium-3 isotope that could potentially power fusion reactors and/or rockets required to reach Mars and beyond.

The mission that caught my attention was Japan's, because the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (or JAXA, that nation's NASA) has enlisted Toyota's help to build a manned rover big enough to make roadkill of those Indian and Chinese Moon-bas (note: this is not its stated mission).

Unlike the dune buggies GM helped engineer for NASA's Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions in 1971-72, Toyota's rover will be a maxivan pressurized to allow two astronauts to work without space suits in between outdoor excursions. The six-wheel-drive EV utilizes in-wheel electric motors powered by a flexible roll-up photovoltaic solar array, a battery, and a fuel cell. That last item is both a Toyota strong suit and a lynchpin of the new rover's mission. The farthest any NASA rover traveled on its silver-zinc potassium hydroxide battery was 22.3 miles, never venturing more than 3.1 miles (walking distance) from the lander. Toyota's rover will spend six years traveling 6,200 miles in total (that's roughly the equatorial circumference of the moon) supporting four manned missions.

Powering the fuel cell will be two replaceable cartridge-tanks carrying 20 kg of hydrogen and 160 kg of oxygen—enough to power roughly 620 miles of presumably round-trip travel to and from a landing craft. I'd expect scheduling and routing to maximize time spent in the moon's 14-Earth-day sunshine, when solar power contributes mightily to the rover's life-support and propulsion needs. Toyota hasn't disclosed power, acceleration, or top speed figures yet, but the record to beat is Eugene Cernan's: 11.2 mph.",Toyota Designs the Ultimate Off-Roader for a JAXA Moon Mission
356,SCIENCE,"In materials science, achromatic optical components can be designed with high transparency and low dispersion. Materials scientists have shown that although metals are highly opaque, densely packed arrays of metallic nanoparticles with more than 75 percent metal by volume can become more transparent to infrared radiation than dielectrics such as germanium. Such arrays can form effective dielectrics that are virtually dispersion-free across ultra-broadband ranges of wavelengths to engineer a variety of next-generation metamaterial-based optical devices.

Scientists can tune the local refractive indices of such materials by altering the size, shape and spacing of nanoparticles to design gradient-index lenses that guide and focus light on the microscale. The electric field can be strongly concentrated in the gaps between metallic nanoparticles for the simultaneous focusing and 'squeezing' of the dielectric field to produce strong, doubly enhanced hotspots. Scientists can use these hotspots to boost measurements made using infrared spectroscopy and other non-linear processes across a broad frequency range.

In a recent study now published in Nature Communications, Samuel J. Palmer and an interdisciplinary research team in the departments of Physics, Mathematics and Nanotechnology in the U.K., Spain and Germany, showed that artificial dielectrics can remain highly transparent to infrared radiation and observed this outcome even when the particles were nanoscopic. They demonstrated the electric field penetrates the particles (rendering them imperfect for conduction) for strong interactions to occur between them in a tightly packed arrangement. The results will allow materials scientists to design optical components that are achromatic for applications in the mid-to-infrared wavelength region.

Palmer and colleagues were able to tune the local refractive index of these components by altering the size, shape and spacing of nanoparticles with sensitivity to the local refractive index of the surrounding environment. The scientists enhanced the electric field in the gaps between the metallic nanoparticles in the array and simultaneously exploited their transparency, tunability and high metallic filling fraction to design a gradient-index lens. The work focused light on the microscale and squeezed the electric field in the nanoscale to produce the doubly enhanced electric field hotspot throughout the infrared (IR) region. The scientists envision that the new work will boost measurements made using IR spectroscopy and other nonlinear processes across a broad-range of frequencies.

Materials scientists are presently able to develop new and advanced materials; however, no new material is truly homogenous in its constitution. Nevertheless, most materials can be characterized using homogenous microscopic properties such as refractive indices wherein the atomistic inhomogeneities are smaller than the average wavelengths of optical light incident on the material. Artificially constructed materials known as metamaterials are described by an effective index when the material contains a sufficiently subwavelength structure. Early metamaterials included artificial dielectrics composed of centimeter-scale arrays of metallic particles capable of guiding and focusing radio waves like a dielectric. The metallic particles of early artificial dielectric materials were so large they behaved as perfect conductors with high transparency to radio waves. Recent research in materials science aims to build effective dielectrics for the visible and infrared spectrum using nanoscale metallic particle arrays. Advances in the assembly of metallic nanoparticles can then allow for sophisticated engineering of unprecedented light-matter interactions in the optical domain.

In the present work, Palmer et al. contrasted the transparency of nanocylinder arrays and nanospheres (although nanoparticles can have other shapes) to germanium in order to demonstrate that the arrays could guide and focus light. The arrays of nanocylinders behaved as effective dielectrics with transverse electric polarized light; where a transverse force on the electrons led to oscillating surface charges that mimicked the oscillating dipoles of an atom in a real dielectric.

In contrast, the response of the cylinders to transverse magnetic polarized light was similar to the bulk metal, since electrons were free to move under the action of the longitudinal electric field without encountering the cylinder surfaces. The arrays of nanospheres in the study behaved as effective dielectrics, regardless of the incident polarization—focusing the electrons in any direction to result in surface charges that imitated the oscillating dipoles of a dielectric. Such arrays showed high transparency compared to real dielectrics such as germanium—even when the system had higher than 75 percent metal.

To test the accuracy of the proposed theory, Palmer et al. produced a highly ordered colloidal supercrystal using gold nanoparticles of 60 nm diameter. They deposited the supercrystal on a germanium substrate and characterized the material (tested physical properties) using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The scientists observed outstanding transparency of the materials, demonstrating the feasibility of experimentally producing metamaterials. Using magnetic near-fields, they showed that the effective dielectrics were transparent enough to act as micrometer-scale lenses to infrared radiation. Despite containing 82 percent metal by volume, the scientists observed that breaking the solid gold into an array of gold nanocylinders produced a transparent lens capable of focusing light, closely resembling the behavior of a homogenous dielectric lens.

The scientists then compared different types of metals (aluminum, silver, gold and titanium) to show that materials with longer skin depths produced the most transparent and least dispersive nanoparticle arrays. Palmer et al. showed that at a fixed wavelength, the ratio of the particle diameter to the skin depth of the metal determined if the particle would behave as quasiparticle dipoles or as perfect conductors.

In addition to high transparency, the scientists could tune the system by controlling the size, shape and space of the particles. For instance, Palmer et al. controlled the aspect ratio of arrays of elliptical cylinders to show that the anisotropic response of the material could be tuned. The numerical results showed that the effective index could be easily tuned to vary by more than 50 percent when the system was rotated. Thereby the scientists were able to tune the effective index by fixing the particle positions and tuning their sizes.

To highlight this potential to tune the local effective index, Palmer et al. then constructed a gradient-index (GRIN) lens using triangular lattices of gold cylinders and varied the diameters of the cylinders with position. Using the GRIN lens, the scientists were able to simultaneously focus light on the microscale and then 'squeeze' light on the nanoscale to produce the intense, 'doubly enhanced' electric field hotspots. Unlike plasmonic enhancements, the effect did not rely on lossy resonances, demonstrating broadband and low-loss properties.

They showed that the focal point of the GRIN lens had to coincide with the region of closest packing to maximize squeezing of the electric field. Unlike magnetic fields that were continuous across the air-metal interfaces in the study, the electric field strongly localized in the gaps. As a result, squeezing a 2 µm wavelength into 2 nm gaps produced strong hotspots of high intensity in the study.

In this way, Palmer et al. constructed low-loss, effective dielectrics from arrays of metallic nanoparticles. The scientists obtained highly transparent arrays that exceeded the transparency of real dielectrics such as germanium; renowned for their transparency to low energy radiation. They were also able to locally tune and control the size, shape and space of the particles forming the new metamaterials. The scientists showed the effective index to be essentially constant for all wavelengths greater than 2 µm. This work will allow materials scientists to design and engineer sophisticated optical devices with metamaterials that guide or enhance light across a broad range of frequencies, essentially without an upper bound on wavelength.",Extraordinarily transparent compact metallic metamaterials

358,SCIENCE,"On Monday, May 20 — World Metrology Day — humanity will have a new definition of the kilogram, the standard unit of mass used the world over.

The change will occur more silently than when a leap second was added to a year. It will disrupt nothing. The number on your bathroom scale isn’t going to change, for better or worse.

But still, it represents an impressive achievement: a victory of humankind against the chaos that pervades the universe.

When scientists met at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles in November, and voted for the change, they were realizing the founding dream of the metric system. The metric system — which evolved into the International System of Units, or SI — was designed to be “for all times, for all people.”

Until now, the kilogram hasn’t been for all time. It’s been imperfect. But starting on Monday, May, 20, it will be.

Until now, the definition of a kilogram has been a hunk of metal in Paris

For more than a century, the kilogram had a very simple definition: It was the mass of a hunk of platinum-iridium alloy that’s been housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sèvres, France since 1889.

It’s called the International Prototype Kilogram (a.k.a. Big K, or Le Grand K), and it has many copies around the world — including several at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland — that are used to calibrate scales and make sure the whole world is on one system of measurement.

These copies make sure a kilogram is a kilogram is a kilogram — whether its being measured on the factory floor of an airplane maker, or on the digital scale at your grocer’s checkout counter. And for those thinking the kilogram doesn’t matter in the US, which uses imperial units like pounds, feet, and gallons, our measurements are derived from SI units. Officially, in the US, 1 pound is defined as 0.45359237 kilograms.

The problem is that Big K is a manmade object, and therefore, it is imperfect. If Big K changes, everything else has to adjust. And this has happened. Big K is not constant. It has lost around 50 micrograms (about the mass of an eyelash) since it was created. But, frustratingly, when Big K loses mass, it’s still exactly one kilogram, per the old definition.

That’s no good. So what’s better?

The new definition anchors the value of the kilogram to a constant in nature, which can never, ever change

Starting Monday, the kilogram will be defined by the Planck constant.

The Planck constant is a concept in quantum mechanics (i.e. the study of how the tiniest components of the universe works), which describes how the tiniest bits of matter release energy in discrete steps or chunks (called quanta). Basically, you can think of the Planck constant as the smallest action an electron can take.

What’s important about the Planck constant is that it can never, ever change. And that makes it a worthy concept to anchor the definition of the kilogram to.

But first, to appreciate why the Planck constant can define the kilogram, it’s helpful to look at how the meter — the world’s standard unit of length — was redefined in terms of the speed of light as an example of why this was necessary.

The meter was originally defined as the length of a bar at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. (It was then redefined to be equal to a certain wavelength of radiation.) Again, the problem with this definition was its imprecision. It was not based on unchanging properties of the universe.

Light speed, on the other hand, is unchanging. By 1983, physicists had gotten really good at measuring the speed of light. So they used it to fix the length of the meter forever, to make it permanent.

Here’s how: They redefined the meter to be equal to the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. Essentially, the definition of the meter is now baked into the definition of the speed of light.

So let’s get back to the Planck constant.

To understand, let’s take a look at it. Written out, the Planck constant is 6.62607015 × 10-34 m2 kg/s.

You can treat the units of this number — meters squared per kilograms divided by seconds — as an equation. Kilograms are in the units, and that’s important. Because once know the value of the Planck constant, and fix it forever, the value of the kilogram also doesn’t change.

Every unit in the Planck constant is defined by an unchanging force of nature. The meter is defined by the speed of light. The second is defined by the frequency of atoms in the element cesium. And once the value of the Planck constant was measured and agreed upon, it means the kilogram can be set too.

And we know the value of the Planck constant, because of years of work in measuring it to a precise degree (read more about that here). This was an enormously hard task: to measure, basically, the smallest thing there is to measure. And it took decades, involving a beautiful and complicated machine called the Kibble balance.

Again, don’t worry: The new kilogram has the same mass as the old kilogram. That’s because scientists used the old kilogram to measure the value of the Planck constant.

In doing so, they essentially anchored the old kilogram to the Planck constant. Just like the length of the meter was anchored to the speed of light. (Also debuting Monday, new definitions for electric current, temperature, and amount of substance. These are also now tied to constants in nature. But unlike the kilogram, their definitions were not based on a physical object. Big K was the last one.)

If you glossed over it all, here’s what all this change boils down to: We’ll no longer need a government — the US, France, whoever — or an international governing body to tell us what a kilogram is. It will be a fundamental truth of the universe, available to anyone with the proper equipment to realize it.",The new kilogram debuts Monday. It’s a massive achievement.
359,SCIENCE,"The Chinese space program started 2019 with a major milestone when the Chang’e 4 lunar lander successfully touched down on the far side of the Moon. It was the first time any country had completed such a feat, the landing itself was just the first of many objectives China had for the mission.

In the days that followed, the lander deployed a rover, snapped photos, and even grew some plants. Its rover had some work of its own to do as well, and a new research paper published in Nature reveals that some of the readings it gathered from lunar surface samples were rather surprising for scientists.

Today, the Moon is relatively quiet and cool, but researchers don’t believe this was always the case. It’s thought that the young Moon was once largely covered in superheated liquid rock that flowed across the surface before eventually cooling.

While the rock was still hot, scientists assume that denser minerals would have naturally settled deep beneath the surface. Once the oceans of magma fully cooled, heavy minerals like pyroxene and olivine would have already been buried. That thinking was seemingly challenged when China’s Yutu-2 rover gathered samples that clearly contained both olivine and pyroxene, but researchers have a very good explanation for why they found those specific minerals on the surface.

Chang’e 4 landed in a spot on the Moon known as the Von Kármán crater, in an area known as the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. The basin is what is left of a massive crater that formed long ago, and researchers believe that the presence of heavy minerals in the surface samples gathered by the rover is evidence that a large impact may have penetrated deep enough to eject a large amount of rock and dust from the Moon’s mantle, covering the area with material that would otherwise have remained buried.

“Geological context suggests that these materials were excavated from below the SPA floor by the nearby 72-km-diameter Finsen impact crater event, and transported to the landing site,” the researchers write. “Continued exploration by Yutu-2 will target these materials on the floor of the Von Kármán crater to understand their geologic context, origin, and abundance, and to assess the possibility of sample-return scenarios.”",China’s lunar rover is helping to unravel a Moon mystery
360,SCIENCE,"May 16 (UPI) -- Bedbugs are notoriously difficult to eradicate. Not even the fiery asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs could rid Earth of its bedbug infestation.

DNA analysis of some 30 different bedbug species showed the insect has been around for at least 115 million years.

Previously, scientists suggested bedbugs emerged between 50 and 60 million years ago. Bats were supposedly the blood-suckers' first victims. But the latest findings -- published this week in the journal Current Biology -- proved the insect predates the bat by some 50 million years.

""To think that the pests that live in our beds today evolved more than 100 million years ago and were walking the earth side by side with dinosaurs, was a revelation,"" Mike Siva-Jothy, professor of animal and plant sciences at the University of Sheffield, said in a news release. ""It shows that the evolutionary history of bed bugs is far more complex than we previously thought.""

Initially, researchers wanted to better understand the insect's practice of ""traumatic insemination."" Males stab their dagger-like penis directly into the bloodstream of females.

Siva-Jothy and his research partners spent 15 years collecting bedbug specimens from remote caves and cliffs. After researchers collected specimens from dozens of species, they realized they could track the insect's genetic origins.

In addition to the timing of the insect's origins, the new analysis revealed the complexity of different bedbug lineages. Some lineages evolved to feed on a single host, while other lineages remain generalists.

Scientists also determined a new species figures out how to start feeding on humans every half a million years. However, the species found most frequently in the beds of humans, the common and the tropical bedbug, predate the emergence of humans by several millions years.

Now that humans are more abundant than ever, however, it is likely a new species will take to the taste of human blood more frequently moving forward.

""These findings will help us better understand how bedbugs evolved the traits that make them effective pests -- that will also help us find new ways of controlling them,"" Siva-Jothy said.",Bedbugs survived the impact event that wiped out the dinosaurs
361,SCIENCE,"FINAL FRONTIER – About 30 million light-years from Earth, two galaxies came together in an epic collision, and the beautiful fallout was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

The collision was more like an accidental hit and run between two neighboring galaxies, NGC 4485 and NGC 4490, that can be found in the Hunting Dogs constellation. Given the distance of these galaxies from us, the collision wasn’t captured in real time. It happened millions of years ago, but we’re just now seeing it.

NGC 4490, a spiral galaxy with a central bar structure made of stars, is the larger galactic neighbor of NGC 4485, an irregular galaxy with no defined shape. The spiral galaxy was passing the irregular galaxy when the collision happened. The gravity of the larger galaxy warped the structure of gas, dust and stars in NGC 4485.

Now, the galaxies are moving away from each other, and the gravitational force between them is warping the shape of each. There’s a 25,000 light-years-long stream of stars and gas between the two galaxies.

But rather than being destructive, the violent encounter encouraged new star formation.

In the image captured by Hubble, the right side of NGC 4485 is bright with the birth of blue stars and pink nebulas signifying that stars are “incubating.” On the left are the remnants of its structure that was evolving normally before the collision.

On the bottom right is a hint of the fleeing NGC 4490.

These blue stars have a short life span, quickly burning through their fuel and exploding. But those explosions also release material and heavy elements into space, which leads to the creation of new stars.

These collisions were common in the early universe when it was smaller and galaxies were in closer proximity, sideswiping and bumping into each other.

362,SCIENCE,"Instead of searching for a needle in a haystack, what if you were able to sweep the entire haystack to one side, leaving only the needle behind? That's the strategy researchers in the University of Georgia College of Engineering followed in developing a new microfluidic device that separates elusive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a sample of whole blood.

CTCs break away from cancerous tumors and flow through the bloodstream, potentially leading to new metastatic tumors. The isolation of CTCs from the blood provides a minimally invasive alternative for basic understanding, diagnosis and prognosis of metastatic cancer. But most studies are limited by technical challenges in capturing intact and viable CTCs with minimal contamination.

""A typical sample of 7 to 10 milliliters of blood may contain only a few CTCs,"" said Leidong Mao, a professor in UGA's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the project's principal investigator. ""They're hiding in whole blood with millions of white blood cells. It's a challenge to get our hands on enough CTCs so scientists can study them and understand them.""

Circulating tumor cells are also difficult to isolate because within a sample of a few hundred CTCs, the individual cells may present many characteristics. Some resemble skin cells while others resemble muscle cells. They can also vary greatly in size.

""People often compare finding CTCs to finding a needle in a haystack,"" said Mao. ""But sometimes the needle isn't even a needle.""

To more quickly and efficiently isolate these rare cells for analysis, Mao and his team have created a new microfluidic chip that captures nearly every CTC in a sample of blood—more than 99% - a considerably higher percentage than most existing technologies.

The team calls its novel approach to CTC detection ""integrated ferrohydrodynamic cell separation,"" or iFCS. They outline their findings in a study published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's Lab on a Chip.

The new device could be ""transformative"" in the treatment of breast cancer, according to Melissa Davis, an assistant professor of cell and developmental biology at Weill Cornell Medicine and a collaborator on the project.

""Physicians can only treat what they can detect,"" Davis said. ""We often can't detect certain subtypes of CTCs, but with the iFCS device we will capture all the subtypes of CTCs and even determine which subtypes are the most informative concerning relapse and disease progression.""

Davis believes the device may ultimately allow physicians to gauge a patient's response to specific treatments much earlier than is currently possible.

While most efforts to capture circulating tumor cells focus on identifying and isolating the few CTCs lurking in a blood sample, the iFCS takes a completely different approach by eliminating everything in the sample that's not a circulating tumor cell.

The device, about the size of a USB drive, works by funneling blood through channels smaller in diameter than a human hair. To prepare blood for analysis, the team adds micron-sized magnetic beads to the samples. The white blood cells in the sample attach themselves to these beads. As blood flows through the device, magnets on the top and bottom of the chip draw the white blood cells and their magnetic beads down a specific channel while the circulating tumor cells continue into another channel.

The device combines three steps in one microfluidic chip, another advance over existing technologies that require separate devices for various steps in the process.

""The first step is a filter that removes large debris in the blood,"" said Yang Liu, a doctoral student in UGA's department of chemistry and the paper's co-lead author. ""The second part depletes extra magnetic beads and the majority of the white blood cells. The third part is designed to focus remaining white blood cells to the middle of channel and to push CTCs to the side walls.""

Wujun Zhao is the paper's other lead author. Zhao, a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, worked on the project while completing his doctorate in chemistry at UGA.

""The success of our integrated device is that it has the capability to enrich almost all CTCs regardless of their size profile or antigen expression,"" said Zhao. ""Our findings have the potential to provide the cancer research community with key information that may be missed by current protein-based or size-based enrichment technologies.""

The researchers say their next steps include automating the iFCS and making it more user-friendly for clinical settings. They also need to put the device through its paces in patient trials. Mao and his colleagues hope additional collaborators will join them and lend their expertise to the project.",Scientists develop technology to capture tumor cells
363,SCIENCE,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before but the ice is screwed. New findings released on Thursday reveal that a quarter of the ice sheets in West Antarctica, the most vulnerable part of the continent, have destabilized. Ice loss has sped up fivefold across the region’s most imperiled glaciers in just 25 years.

Scientists used 800 million satellite measurements taken since 1992 to reach their conclusions. The results, published in Geophysical Research Letters, underscore just how rapid the changes taking place are and the perils coastal communities could face if ice continues its runaway melt.

The ways that we know the West Antarctic is melting down are manifold. There’s measurements on the ground, flyovers by NASA scientists, and occasional visits by boat. But to get the big picture, satellites provide a crucial view from space. Researchers used data from a suite of European Space Agency satellites that have been monitoring Antarctica since 1992. Those satellite have lasers that measure how high the ice that covers Antarctica and extends out to sea is, and the 25 years of records in the analysis allowed the researchers to see how ice height has changed over time. The researchers identified areas where rapid thinning and ice loss occurred as unstable.

The good news is that the East Antarctic, the highest and coldest part of Antarctica (and which contains most of the continent’s ice), is largely stable. Still, what’s happening in the west isn’t insignificant. The research reveals that the region has shed enough ice over the past 25 years to fill Lake Erie near 12 times over. And it gets worse than that!

The findings show that 24 percent of the ice sheet is now unstable, with some parts having thinned 400 feet over the past 25 years alone. That’s what ice researcher at the University of Leeds and lead author Andy Shepherd called “extraordinary amounts” in a press release. Extraordinary is not a superlative you want to hear in the case of the West Antarctic, though. The imbalance has caused ice from the imperiled Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, hold back massive stores of ice on land, to spill into the ocean five times faster in 2017 compared to 1992, contributing to an uptick in sea levels.

If those glaciers break up and the ice behind them falls into the sea, it could raise sea levels more than 10 feet and completely reshape coastlines. The new study is an important check-in on how close to the edge we might be.","A Quarter of West Antarctica's Ice Is Now Unstable, Study Finds"
364,SCIENCE,"The crowds were packed along that same stretch of beach, cameras ready. Their eyes trained on the site that sent men to the moon 50 years ago but had now been reborn as the perch for another powerful rocket ready to fly.

The scene here last month was at once familiar and nostalgic, the past revived. But it was also altogether different. The rocket on the pad, the Falcon Heavy, was developed not by NASA but by a private company, SpaceX.

Many in the crowd weren’t born when Walter Cronkite narrated the lunar landing for millions and this stretch of coastline held a sacrosanct spot in the national consciousness. Instead, in the years since the Apollo era, the Cape had become a symbol of the abandoned dreams and diminished ambitions that ultimately led to the retirement of the space shuttle eight years ago and the end of human spaceflight from U.S. soil.

Now, though, the Space Coast is coming back. A host of companies have laid claim to the old government launchpads. Buildings left vacant have been torn down or rebuilt. And the Cape is once again on the verge of sending humans back to space for the first time since 2011, the crescendo of a new, reinvigorated space age that many hope will restore the flag-waving pride of a bygone era.

As new life is being breathed back into this venerable coastline, the resurrection is coming in fits and starts, and in an entirely new form that is far more unstable and unpredictable than the one infused by government cash in the 1960s. Today, the new space age is built on the fortunes of private enterprise, subject to the whims of the economy. And like the next chapter of America’s grand adventure in space, the future of the Space Coast is far from guaranteed.

Having seen the devastation that can come when a town reliant on a single industry buckles, local leaders have gone to great lengths to try to diversify their economy. They’ve put in special taxing districts and offered incentives to woo all sorts of businesses to create a better sense of stability.

But this is a place where kids go to Astronaut High School, where the area code, 321, is designed to mimic the launch countdown and reminders of the Space Age are everywhere, including monuments to astronauts and streets named Apollo Road and Tranquility Boulevard.

This is where the Space Age was born, with heroes named John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride. This is where the crowds crammed the beaches before launch, counting down in unison, and captured the world’s imagination.

And then it didn’t.

The question now is: Can it again?

At the dawn of the Space Age, this swampy stretch of coastline quickly became a thriving boomtown. Fueled by the Cold War to beat the Soviet Union to the moon, the population soared with engineers and rocket scientists. Astronauts with the “right stuff” trained by running on the beach during the day and partied at night on the Cocoa Beach strip full of jazz clubs and restaurants.

It was “a glamorous honky-tonk town with young girls twisting in bars, gamblers playing poker upstairs, lots of noise,” as Gay Talese wrote in the New York Times in 1965.

“It was total excitement,” said Roy Tharpe, 78, who grew up in the area and started working for NASA in 1963. “It seemed like we were launching rockets every three or four days — and they would explode all the time.”

If the Cape had a cathedral, it was Launch Complex 39A. Built for the Apollo missions, its spire stood more than 500 feet tall and launched the Apollo astronauts to the moon in July 1969 on a Saturn V rocket so powerful it felt like an earthquake.

After Apollo, 39A was reborn as the host for space shuttle launches. But when the shuttle program was shuttered after a 30-year run, the venerable launch site started rusting away in the salt air, joining the many other abandoned pads that dot the Cape like the ruins of a once-great civilization.

At the peak of the recession, the unemployment rate in Brevard County, where the Space Coast is largely based, spiked to 12 percent. The real estate market plunged. The median price for single-family homes fell from nearly $250,000 in 2007 to less than $100,000 by 2011.

“What we didn’t anticipate was that [the shuttle retirement] would coincide with the recession — the deepest, longest recession,” said Lynda Weatherman, the president and CEO of the Space Coast Economic Development Commission. “I saw the numbers, and it was bad. And Florida was a bad place, and Brevard was particularly bad, especially for the housing markets. So we got clobbered.”

By 2013, maintenance on pad 39A was costing NASA $100,000 a month and even a spokesman admitted at the time that the launchpad had “not been kept up.” Since the facility is on the National Register of Historic Places, it could not be torn down. NASA was desperate to find someone to use it — even a start-up company that improbably was leading the commercialization of space.

SpaceX, the California venture founded by Elon Musk, was looking for a new launchpad and won the rights to take over the site. The company had secured contracts from NASA to carry cargo to the International Space Station and was winning back the commercial launch contracts that had gone overseas. With a growing manifest, and perhaps a quixotic faith in the future, SpaceX was looking to expand.

Others soon followed.

Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, had made a last-minute bid to lay claim to 39A, touching off a feud with Musk’s SpaceX. But without a rocket capable of flying from the site, Blue Origin was rebuffed. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Instead, it set its sights on another fading relic, launchpad 36, just down the road. Home to 145 launches, including the Mariner missions, which sent probes deep into the solar system, it, too, was wasting away. In 2015, Blue Origin reached a deal to take it over for the new rocket it was developing, called New Glenn.

“The pad had stood silent for more than 10 years — too long,” Bezos said at the time. “We can’t wait to fix that.”

Blue Origin has also built a massive rocket manufacturing facility nearby with plans to expand. Across the street, OneWeb, a satellite company that wants to create a worldwide Internet system delivered from space, also has a new plant.

Boeing has taken over an old space shuttle processing facility where it is building a spacecraft designed to fly NASA astronauts to space from another nearby launchpad.

And NASA is developing a massive rocket, the Space Launch System, that it hopes will help get astronauts to the moon within five years. NASA is scrambling to get its first launch, with the Orion crew capsule, built by Lockheed Martin, off the ground next year.

The future of the Space Coast is also being written by the smaller start-ups beginning to emerge in an industry once dominated by big government programs and military industrial complex contractors.

A Los Angeles-based company called Relativity, founded by former employees from Blue Origin and SpaceX, is working on a rocket that’s built entirely by 3-D printing. The goal is to be able to launch small satellites quickly and affordably. Recently, the company signed an agreement to take over the Cape’s launchpad 16.

Next door, at launchpad 20, another start-up, Firefly, intends to launch the rockets it plans to build at a nearby facility.

Taken as a whole, the activity is helping NASA fulfill its goals of turning the Kennedy Space Center from a government-dominated facility to one with multiple tenants that showcases a new space economy.

“When you consider that in all of human history, only three nations have sent humans to space: the United States, Russia and China,” said Robert Cabana, the director of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “Today, there are several U.S. companies building space vehicles to take humans to space.”

Outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center, developers are building residential communities up and down the coastline. The unemployment rate dropped to below 4 percent earlier this year. The tax base has bloomed with monthly taxable sales rebounding from a low of nearly $450 million in 2010 to over $850 million last year. And housing prices are back where they were before the recession.

The coast was known first and foremost “as a launch site,” said Weatherman, the head of the local economic development commission. “But we knew we could do more than that.”

The city of Titusville put out a video recently highlighting all the development going on across the town: an 18,000-square-foot day-care enter, a 170-unit subdivision, a new Hyatt and a new Marriott.

The Miracle City Mall, torn down after the recession, has been rebuilt as a new shopping center, with a new Harley Davidson dealership. Nearby, there’s a trendy new brewpub that serves oxtail mac and cheese and fancy cocktails like the “creamsicle fizz.”

“We got our very own Starbucks,” said Jim Hale, who works as a volunteer with the Air Force Space and Missile Museum here. “That was big. . . . Now everything is new again.”

In the end, the double blow of the loss of the shuttle program and the recession was devastating, leaving streets filled with empty buildings. But it was not as bad as it could have been. “We were preparing for a Category 5 hurricane,” said Robin Fisher, a former county commissioner. “We got a Category 3.”

By the time the shuttle program was ending, a new commercial space industry was starting to take form. It was unclear what its future was or how successful it would be. But there was an enthusiasm surrounding it, and local officials embraced it.

“That was the second act for space in our county,” Weatherman said.

Still, space is a risky business. While many new entrants are trying to make their mark on the Cape, not all of them will survive. And for all of the success stories here, there have been missteps. SpaceX has had two rockets explode, one destroying a pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Then, just recently, one of its spacecraft blew up during an engine test, sending a huge plume of smoke over the Cape.

NASA has turned over a few facilities to private companies that showed promise but ultimately faltered.

“Not everything worked,” Cabana, the director of the Kennedy Space Center, said. Some “lost contracts they thought they were going to get, and the bottom line was they were unsuccessful.”

There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for the commercial space industry. The investment money is pouring in. New companies seem to pop up every day. But some may be reminded of the old maxim: The quickest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire.

They had packed the beaches once again. This time for the launch of the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful rocket in the world currently in operation.

At liftoff, it christened pad 39A on a warm Thursday evening in April, thundering away on a towering pillow of smoke.

On the beaches, the crowds came not just for the launch, but a bit of rocket artistry unimaginable a generation ago.

Instead of ditching its rocket boosters into the ocean after flight, SpaceX flies them back so they can be reused — a bit of aerial acrobatics the company says helps lower the cost of spaceflight.

On this day, both side boosters flew back to one of the newest structures on the Cape: a pair of landing pads. The crowds craned their necks skyward to watch the boosters touching down in unison, twin sonic booms announcing their arrival.

Hale, the Air Force museum volunteer, watched from a nearby park with his wife, awestruck, as this new chapter evoked a memory of the old — and a question: “Where is Walter Cronkite when you need him?”

365,SCIENCE,"A team of Swedish and British scientists have studied the heritability of dog ownership using information from 35,035 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry. The new study suggests that genetic variation explains more than half of the variation in dog ownership, implying that the choice of getting a dog is heavily influenced by an individual's genetic make-up.

Dogs were the first domesticated animal and have had a close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years. Today, dogs are common pets in our society and are considered to increase the well-being and health of their owners. The team compared the genetic make-up of twins (using the Swedish Twin Registry -- the largest of its kind in the world) with dog ownership. The results are published for the first time in Scientific Reports. The goal was to determine whether dog ownership has a heritable component.

""We were surprised to see that a person's genetic make-up appears to be a significant influence in whether they own a dog. As such, these findings have major implications in several different fields related to understanding dog-human interaction throughout history and in modern times. Although dogs and other pets are common household members across the globe, little is known how they impact our daily life and health. Perhaps some people have a higher innate propensity to care for a pet than others."" says Tove Fall, lead author of the study, and Professor in Molecular Epidemiology at the Department of Medical Sciences and the Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University.

Carri Westgarth, Lecturer in Human-Animal interaction at the University of Liverpool and co-author of the study, adds: ""These findings are important as they suggest that supposed health benefits of owning a dog reported in some studies may be partly explained by different genetics of the people studied.""

Studying twins is a well-known method for disentangling the influences of environment and genes on our biology and behaviour. Because identical twins share their entire genome, and non-identical twins on average share only half of the genetic variation, comparisons of the within-pair concordance of dog ownership between groups can reveal whether genetics play a role in owning a dog. The researchers found concordance rates of dog ownership to be much larger in identical twins than in non-identical ones -- supporting the view that genetics indeed plays a major role in the choice of owning a dog.

""These kind of twin studies cannot tell us exactly which genes are involved, but at least demonstrate for the first time that genetics and environment play about equal roles in determining dog ownership. The next obvious step is to try to identify which genetic variants affect this choice and how they relate to personality traits and other factors such as allergy"" says Patrik Magnusson, senior author of the study and Associate Professor in Epidemiology at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Karolinska Insitutet, Sweden and Head of the Swedish Twin Registry.

""The study has major implications for understanding the deep and enigmatic history of dog domestication"" says zooarchaeologist and co-author of the study Keith Dobney, Chair of Human Palaeoecology in the Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology at the University of Liverpool. ""Decades of archaeological research have helped us construct a better picture of where and when dogs entered into the human world, but modern and ancient genetic data are now allowing us to directly explore why and how?""",Owning a dog is influenced by our genetic make-up
366,SCIENCE,"UK scientists have created an artificial version of the stomach bug E. coli that is based on an entirely synthetic form of DNA.

At the same time, Syn61 as they are calling it, has had its genetic code significantly redesigned.

It's been done in a manner that will pave the way for designer bacteria that could manufacture new catalysts, drugs, proteins and materials.

Other scientists working in synthetic biology have hailed the development.

Genetic engineer Prof George Church, from Harvard University, US, has hailed the work as ""a major breakthough"".

Dr Tom Ellis, a reader in synthetic biology at Imperial College London called it super-impressive.

Syn61's 4 million genetic letters make this the largest entire genome to be synthesised from scratch.

They were ordered in short segments from a laboratory supplies company, before being assembled into half-million-letter lengths in yeast cells by natural cellular machinery.

At this point, the genome engineers' job became a bit like a railway engineer's maintenance programme - replacing the E. coli genome piecewise - section by section - rather than all at once.

""The bacterial chromosome is so big,"" team leader Jason Chin told the BBC, ""we needed an approach that would let us see what had gone wrong if there had been any mistakes along the way.""

So it was only after each half-million-letter segment had been tested in partially synthetic bacteria that the eight segments were brought together in Syn61.

The approach is more cautious than that used by bio-entrepreneur, Craig Venter, whose microbial replicant based on the tiny organism Mycoplasma genitaliumwas presented to the world in 2010.

That was a milestone, Tom Ellis recalls, but consumed the efforts over many years of an entire institute, set up, run and named by Venter.

The new work was conducted by a small team at Cambridge's world-famous Laboratory for Molecular Biology, and could readily be scaled up to bigger genomes in any well equipped lab, according to Dr Chin.

In the event, the team found only four mistakes out of the entire four million synthesised genetic letters, and they were easily corrected.

But Dr Chin's ambitions go well beyond record-breaking chromosomes.

The new genome has also been recoded, as a first step allowing the synthetic biologists to incorporate components into biomolecules that do not exist in nature.

The code on DNA carries instructions for the cell for how to assemble proteins, the primary biomolecules of a body.

Just as DNA is composed of strings of single nucleic acid elements, so proteins are made of strings of simple amino acids.

Nature has a palette of 20, with names like serine, leucine and alanine. Their chemistry dictates the properties of the protein they make - from hair to muscle proteins, to stomach enzymes.

But although nature relies on only 20, the DNA code could accommodate up to 64. DNA biologist Francis Crick, who worked at the LMB in its early days, called this a frozen accident.

As a result, many of the DNA ""words"" or codons, lead to the same amino acid. There are six ways, for example, of writing the instructions for serine - which Chin sees as wasteful.

""We have stripped out some of the duplications in the natural code to make it more efficient,"" says his colleague Julius Fredens, who oversaw much of the detailed lab work.

They set out to find all instances of two variants of the serine instruction, and synthetically replace them with two of the other synonyms - a task similar in scale to finding all the ""C's and Q's"" in the bible and replacing them with ""K's"", so that ""quick"" becomes ""kwikk"".

The team also reduced the number of codons (like full stops) marking the ends of genes from three to two. There were over 18,000 replacements in all.

""This was a really radical transformation,"" Chin argues.

There were further edits to remove the cellular machinery that reads the lost codons - it was no longer needed.

Syn61 turns out not to be quite so vigorous as its natural E. coli cousin - it grows about 60% slower. Although that could suggest there may be something fundamentally important about the alternative spellings in the genetic code, Julius Fredens believes they have identified smaller issues in Syn61, which should be readily corrected to fully restore the organism's health.

Tom Ellis is impressed the bacterium works at all, saying: ""These 18,000 changes mean that every gene on the chromosome will have been altered - and yet it's still alive!""

One effect of the recode is that it separates Syn61 from all other life. Until now, organisms have been able to swap genes, often via viruses, because they all share the same basic language. Now, a virus trying to infect Syn61 will find the host cell lacks the tools to translate the viral DNA; the attempt would fail.

George Church calls this the ""cliffhanger"". In an earlier attempt in his lab, with a more limited set of edits, one in five viruses still managed to replicate.

""Chin's success will embolden the rest of us working to make many organisms (industrial microbes, plants, animals, and human cells) resistant to all viruses by this recoding approach,"" Church wrote in an email.

Chin says that test has not been tried yet with Syn61, but it is high on their to-do list.

But Chin's grand plan is to make biochemistry more diverse.

With only 61 of Syn61's 64 possible codons taken up as instructions for natural amino acids (hence the name), that leaves three that can now be reassigned to unnatural ones that could introduce entirely new chemistry into the cell.

Chin has pioneered this kind of synthetic biology introducing elements that make proteins glow, or respond to light by becoming active, or turned off.

Fredens reckons there may already be 200 unnatural building blocks that could be brought into protein chemistry this way, and that these would work with the techniques already developed at LMB and elsewhere.

""It's pretty mind blowing that you can expand the genetic alphabet this way,"" Fredens admits. ""I think we're pretty far from realising how much we can do with it, producing things we have never seen before.""

Chin's focus is very much on what the opportunities will do for science, talking of alternative proteins that will spy on the inner workings of cells, or help pharmaceuticals companies build better drugs. But the possibilities are endless. Tom Ellis speculates on the idea of connecting molecular hooks onto proteins that would allow them to click together to make vast molecular networks in smart materials.

It may sound like a brave new molecular world, but Chin says it should not be scary.

""People have legitimate concerns,"" he accepts. ""There is a dual use to anything we invent. But what's important is that we have a debate about what we should and shouldn't do. And that these experiments are done in a well controlled way.""",Artificial life form given 'synthetic DNA'

369,SCIENCE,"This planet has a problem with plastic. Not just the big masses of it accumulating in the Pacific, but with the tiny bits that are blowing into pristine mountaintop habitats. The flecks showing up in a range of sea creatures. The specks materializing even in human feces.

Now scientists have exposed a potential new consequence of the plastic menace: The toxins the material leaches into seawater inhibit the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of the bacteria Prochlorococcus, which is responsible for producing an estimated 20 percent of the oxygen we breathe. That means Prochlorococcus is also responsible for 20 percent of carbon capture on this planet (one molecule of carbon goes in, one molecule of oxygen goes out), theoretically spelling trouble for humanity’s quest to keep CO2 out of the atmosphere. This is early research, though, and comes with several big caveats. Indeed, it exposes the challenges of studying a threat as new and omnipresent as plastic pollution.

Prochlorococcus is a kind of cyanobacteria (taking their name from their blue color) that floats in oceans the world over. We’re talking a lot of single-celled organisms, with an estimated global population of 1027. Like a plant, Prochlorococcus uses photosynthesis to manufacture its own food, taking in carbon and spitting out oxygen, making it a lead actor in the carbon cycle that humans have spun so out of control.

Unfortunately, the researchers found that in addition to carbon, the bacteria are taking in plastic toxins leached into the water, known as leachates. They did this in the lab by mixing different amounts of plastic into an artificial seawater base, in which they grew Prochlorococcus. They compared the results to a control of Prochlorococcus grown in untainted artificial seawater.

The researchers found clear reactions that varied based on the concentration of leachate, which is indicative of a toxicological response. At low concentrations, there was no difference with the control. But as they increased the concentration of the leachate, they saw the bacteria’s physiological response going progressively haywire. “When the plastic leachates increase in concentration, you see that the cells don't grow as well, and in fact at the highest concentrations they are dying,” says microbial oceanographer Lisa Moore of Macquarie University in Australia, a co-author on the paper.

Moore and her colleagues were also able to measure photosynthetic activity at these different concentrations with an instrument that looks at the intensity of the cells’ fluorescence. “We saw parallels to what we saw with the growth: a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, and in fact a pretty dramatic decrease with the higher concentrations,” says Moore.

Going further, the researchers looked at the genes of these bacterial populations, whether they were being expressed more or less in the presence of leachate. A large portion of those being expressed less were associated with photosynthesis, “which was absolutely consistent with what we were seeing in terms of the photosynthetic efficiency being decreased, and then the growth being decreased,” says Moore.

At fault could be any number of things in the plastics. Flame retardants, for one, and other additives that give plastic its flexibility. Zinc in particular might be having an outsized effect on the bacteria—it’s used in plastic components ranging from colorants to heat stabilizers.

Now, we’ve got some caveats to this study. The biggest is that the work was done in the lab, not out in the ocean, and necessarily so. To do an experiment like this, the researchers had to carefully control the samples of artificial seawater so they wouldn’t be tainted with other contaminants that could throw off the results.

“That's a limitation, trying to equate what concentrations we did in the lab versus what's in the oceans,” says Moore. “So what we were at least trying to estimate in the article were the number of particles that are found in the ocean, relative to the number of cells that are found in the ocean.”

Did plastic leachates have a startling effect on Prochlorococcus in the lab? Yes, absolutely. But that doesn’t mean the effect necessarily happens out in nature. “We know plastic is bad,” says Luiz Rocha, the curator of fishes at the California Academy of Sciences, who studies ocean plastic. “This paper shows it can negatively affect one of the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth, but we don't know if the concentrations of these chemicals ever get this high in the ocean.”

“I have the exact same problem with sunscreens,” Rocha adds. “All of the studies that analyzed their effects on corals were done in aquaria using very high concentrations only possibly found in beaches visited by thousands of people per day. So in reality, banning sunscreen is doing little to nothing to save coral reefs.”

None of this is to say that plastic isn’t terrible for the planet. Big pieces, known as macroplastics, are ending up in the stomachs of all manner of sea creatures. And while microplastics (bits under 5 millimeters long) are everywhere, science isn’t sure yet what their effects might be. “I'm the first to say our problem with plastics is the macroplastics,” says University of Michigan eco-toxicologist Allen Burton, who studies plastics. The bits that are strangling sea birds and clogging beaches and even sinking to the very bottom of the ocean. “We all know how horrible the impacts have been with so many species due to macroplastics. Microplastics, not so much. Leachates, probably even less.”

The core of the problem is that plastic pollution is a very new science. Researchers are still feeling their way through an environmental threat whose epicness is likely only second to climate change. Some 8 million metric tons of plastic enters the sea every year. And between 2015 and 2025, the amount of plastic pouring into the ocean could increase tenfold.

370,SCIENCE,"The people who lived at Huseby-Kiev in western Sweden 10,000 years ago made their living by hunting and fishing. That doesn't sound surprising until you consider that this was a landscape that had, until recently, been covered by ice sheets 4km (2.5 miles) thick. How they occupied the re-emerging landscape is a bit of a mystery. We don't know much about who they actually were, where they came from, or how they made their way into Sweden as the ice receded.

In the 1990s, archaeologists recovered a few chewed-up lumps of birch bark pitch, some of which still held fingerprints and tooth marks left behind from millennia ago. Using this ancient chewing gum, archaeologist Natalija Kashuba of Uppsala University recently recovered DNA from two women and one man who had lived, worked, and apparently chewed gum on the shores of ancient Sweden. That means we can now link DNA from ancient people to their artifacts, and that's a big clue about how people migrated into Scandinavia after the Ice Age.

Two groups of hunter-gatherers met in Sweden

Birch bark pitch, like other saps and resins from various trees around the world, makes a decent chewing gum. When chewed and softened, it's also a handy glue for repairing cracked pottery or gluing bone points onto stone blades to make a vicious-looking composite point (see gallery). That's how people at Huseby-Kiev seem to have used it.

Based on the tools and other hints that these people also left behind, it seems that people converged on Scandinavia from two directions as the ice sheets receded. One group migrated northward from western Europe, while another migrated southwest from the plains of modern-day Russia. These two groups of people each had their own unique ways of making stone tools, which is how archaeologists have managed to tell their sites apart and trace their migration paths.

The people who came from Russia, for example, brought a technology called pressure flaking, which involves using a pointed stick or bone to break off small flakes from the edge of a stone tool, creating a sharp blade. Over time, this new eastern pressure-flaking technology eventually replaced the older western European techniques.

When these two populations of hunter-gatherers met in Scandinavia, they seem to have intermarried. Over time, the mixing of their gene pools created a new population, which anthropologists call Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (anthropologists are not widely known for creative naming schemes). We know this from DNA from human remains several centuries younger than the site at Huseby-Kiev.

The gum at Huseby-Kiev is the oldest human DNA ever recovered from Scandinavia, and it sheds some light on the time when these populations were first encountering each other.

When Kashuba and her colleagues compared the DNA from all three pieces of chewing gum to databases of ancient DNA from other sites, it turned out that the two women and the man from Huseby-Kiev were closely related to the Scandinavian hunter-gatherer group—but their genomes looked more like Mesolithic people from western Europe than from Russia. It's the first time archaeologists have found Scandinavian hunter-gatherer DNA clearly linked with stone tools, and it shows that people in Scandinavia 10,000 years ago were already using the newer eastern European method of pressure-flaking.

It also shows that the spread of the new technology wasn't just carried by people from eastern Europe. The two groups were trading ideas, not just genes.

On a smaller scale, the DNA samples in the three unassuming lumps of pitch reveal something about the lives and culture of people 10,000 years ago. The tooth marks in the gum came from deciduous teeth (which most people call baby teeth), suggesting that making stone tools wasn't strictly adult work. And two of the three genomes were genetically female, which suggests that tool-making also wasn't a gender-specific job.

As DNA sequencing technology improves, archaeologists are finding ancient DNA in surprising places. Earlier this year, the stem of a clay pipe revealed the genome of an enslaved woman who once lived in Maryland. Kashuba and her colleagues say that gums, resins, and similar materials from around the world may also be good sources of ancient DNA, even in places where few human bones have managed to preserve DNA from the distant past. They also suggest that these materials may hold proteins and other molecules which could offer clues about ancient people's diets and microbiomes.","Archaeologists find DNA in a 10,000-year-old piece of chewing gum"

372,SCIENCE,"The amount of ice at the poles and in glaciers around the world has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades due to climate change. The ice loss will become more and more prominent as temperatures continue to rise but to accurately predict the specific changes we need precise data.

With that in mind, researchers from the University of Edinburgh wondered if they could improve on the data collected by the European Space Agency’s satellite CryoSat. They were able to reprocess observations collected since 2010 and dramatically improve the resolution, delivering CryoSat's sharpest 3D map of Antarctica yet.

The results were presented this week at the Living Planet Symposium in Milan, Italy. CryoSat carries a radar altimeter that is used to measure the height of the world’s ice. The satellite sends a microwave pulse and times how long it takes for the pulse to bounce off the ice and come back to the satellite. Differences in return time correspond to precise differences in altitude.

While the approach has been very useful for imaging the vast icy expanse of the southernmost continent, it doesn’t deliver very detailed results regarding Antarctica's terrain. The data analysis conducted so far has focused on the first data point coming back to the craft so it might be missing the finer details of ground formation.

The research team used an approach called “swath processing”, which takes into account all the data coming from the microwave pulse. By employing this technique, they were able to reduce the spatial resolution on the surface to less than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles). This allowed the production of the excellent 3D map, which gives precise altitudes and quite detailed information on geographical formation.

There is a lot of interest in producing detailed maps of Antarctica. Just last year, the best terrain map of the continent was released by researchers. The map is actually so good that it is the best map of a continent ever made.

373,SCIENCE,"New discoveries made at the Klasies River Cave in South Africa's southern Cape, where charred food remains from hearths were found, provide the first archaeological evidence that anatomically modern humans were roasting and eating plant starches, such as those from tubers and rhizomes, as early as 120,000 years ago.

The new research by an international team of archaeologists, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, provides archaeological evidence that has previously been lacking to support the hypothesis that the duplication of the starch digestion genes is an adaptive response to an increased starch diet.

""This is very exciting. The genetic and biological evidence previously suggested that early humans would have been eating starches, but this research had not been done before,"" says Lead author Cynthia Larbey of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. The work is part of a systemic multidisciplinary investigation into the role that plants and fire played in the lives of Middle Stone Age communities.

The interdisciplinary team searched for and analysed undisturbed hearths at the Klasies River archaeological site.

""Our results showed that these small ashy hearths were used for cooking food and starchy roots and tubers were clearly part of their diet, from the earliest levels at around 120,000 years ago through to 65,000 years ago,"" says Larbey. ""Despite changes in hunting strategies and stone tool technologies, they were still cooking roots and tubers.""

Professor Sarah Wurz from the School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa (Wits University) and principal investigator of the site says the research shows that ""early human beings followed a balanced diet and that they were ecological geniuses, able to exploit their environments intelligently for suitable foods and perhaps medicines"".

By combining cooked roots and tubers as a staple with protein and fats from shellfish, fish, small and large fauna, these communities were able to optimally adapt to their environment, indicating great ecological intelligence as early as 120,000 years ago.

""Starch diet isn't something that happens when we started farming, but rather, is as old as humans themselves,"" says Larbey. Farming in Africa only started in the last 10,000 years of human existence.

Humans living in South Africa 120,000 years ago formed and lived in small bands.

""Evidence from Klasies River, where several human skull fragments and two maxillary fragments dating 120,000 years ago occur, show that humans living in that time period looked like modern humans of today. However, they were somewhat more robust,"" says Wurz.

Klasies River is a very famous early human occupation site on the Cape coast of South Africa, excavated by Wurz, who, along with Susan Mentzer of the Senckenberg Institute and Eberhard Karls Universitaet ,Tübingen, investigated the small (c. 30cm in diameter) hearths.

374,SCIENCE,"The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has produced a beautiful image of NGC 4485, an irregular galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici, about 30 million light-years away from Earth. NGC 4485 shows all the signs of having been involved in a hit-and-run accident with a bypassing galaxy, NGC 4490; rather than destroying NGC 4485, the chance encounter is spawning a new generation of stars.

Their interactions have warped them both, turning them from spiral galaxies into irregular ones.

NGC 4485, which is the smaller galaxy in the pair, and NGC 4490 are now moving away from each other.

Still engaged in a destructive yet creative dance, the gravitational force between them continues to warp each of them out of all recognition, while at the same time creating the conditions for huge regions of intense star formation.

This galactic tug-of-war created a stream of material about 25,000 light-years long which connects the two galaxies.

The stream is made up of bright knots and huge pockets of gassy regions, as well as enormous regions of star formation in which young, massive, blue stars are born.

Short-lived, however, these stars quickly run out of fuel and end their lives in dramatic explosions.

While such an event seems to be purely destructive, it also enriches the cosmic environment with heavier elements and delivers new material to form a new generation of stars.

Two very different regions are now apparent in NGC 4485; on the left are hints of the galaxy’s previous spiral structure, which was at one time undergoing ‘normal’ galactic evolution.

375,SCIENCE,"US computer scientist Katie Bouman, who became a global sensation over her role in generating the world's first image of a black hole, has described the painstaking process as akin to listening to a piano with broken keys.

Testifying before Congress on Thursday, the postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics also suggested the technology developed by the project could have practical applications in the fields of medical imaging, seismic prediction and self-driving cars.

A photo released last month of the star-devouring monster in the heart of the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy revealed a dark core encircled by a flame-orange halo of white hot plasma.

But since M87 is 55 million light years away, ""This ring appears incredibly small on the sky: roughly 40 microarcseconds in size, comparable to the size of an orange on the surface of the Moon as viewed from our location on Earth,"" said Bouman.

The laws of physics would require a telescope the size of our entire planet to view it: an impossible proposition.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration instead spent over a decade building an Earth-sized computational telescope that combined signals received by various telescopes working in pairs around the world.

However, since there are a limited number of locations, the telescopes are able to capture only some frequencies, leaving large gaps in information.

""As an analogy, you can think about the measurements the EHT makes a bit like notes in a song; each measurement corresponds to the tone of one note, "" said Bouman.

""Observing the black hole with the Event Horizon Telescope is a bit like listening to a song being played on a piano with over half of its keys broken.""

The approach led to numerous gaps that could be filled with infinite possibilities consistent with the data.

""But just as your brain may still be able to recognize a song being played on a broken piano if there are enough functioning keys, we can design algorithms to intelligently fill in the EHT's missing information to reveal the underlying black hole image,"" she concluded.

While the images were captured in 2017, the final result had to be independently validated by four EHT teams working around the world to avoid shared human bias.

The four images they produced varied slightly, but they all contained the same basic structure.

""Seeing these images for the first time was truly amazing and one of my life's happiest memories,"" recalled Bouman, who maintained a broad smile throughout her testimony.

The final image released to the public on April 10 this year was a composite of the four images further tuned by algorithms designed to eliminate human preferences.

Bouman said she first began working on the EHT as a graduate student studying computer vision at MIT and found the problem shared striking similarities with work she had done on brain imaging based on limited data from an MRI scanner.

""Thus, although the project was well outside of my core area, and I had no background in astrophysics let alone black holes, I hoped that I might be able to make a difference.""

She also hailed the early-career scientists who had come to the project from various fields and ranged from post doctorates to undergraduates whose work was vital to the project.

""However, like black holes, many early-career scientists with significant contributions often go unseen,"" she said.","Imaging black hole like listening to broken piano, says scientist"
376,SCIENCE,"Neanderthals and modern humans diverged at least 800,000 years ago, substantially earlier than indicated by most DNA-based estimates, according to new research by a UCL academic.

The research, published in Science Advances , analyzed dental evolutionary rates across different hominin species , focusing on early Neanderthals. It shows that the teeth of hominins from Sima de los Huesos, Spain - ancestors of the Neanderthals - diverged from the modern human lineage earlier than previously assumed.

The Discovery of the Neanderthal Teeth

Sima de los Huesos is a cave site in Atapuerca Mountains, Spain, where archaeologists have recovered fossils of almost 30 people. Previous studies date the site to around 430,000 years ago (Middle Pleistocene), making it one of the oldest and largest collections of human remains discovered to date.

Dr Aida Gomez-Robles (UCL Anthropology), said: ""Any divergence time between Neanderthals and modern humans younger than 800,000 years ago would have entailed an unexpectedly fast dental evolution in the early Neanderthals from Sima de los Huesos.""

""There are different factors that could potentially explain these results, including strong selection to change the teeth of these hominins or their isolation from other Neanderthals found in mainland Europe. However, the simplest explanation is that the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans was older than 800,000 years. This would make the evolutionary rates of the early Neanderthals from Sima de los Huesos roughly comparable to those found in other species.""

Modern humans share a common ancestor with Neanderthals, the extinct species that were our closest prehistoric relatives . However, the details on when and how they diverged are a matter of intense debate within the anthropological community.

Ancient DNA analysis has generally indicated that both lineages diverged around 300,000 to 500,000 years ago, which has strongly influenced the interpretation of the hominin fossil record.

This divergence time, however, is not compatible with the anatomical and genetic Neanderthal similarities observed in the hominins from Sima de los Huesos. The Sima fossils are considered likely Neanderthal ancestors based on both anatomical features and DNA analysis .

Dr Gomez-Robles said: ""Sima de los Huesos hominins are characterized by very small posterior teeth (premolars and molars) that show multiple similarities with classic Neanderthals. It is likely that the small and Neanderthal-looking teeth of these hominins evolved from the larger and more primitive teeth present in the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans.""

Dental shape has evolved at very similar rates across all hominin species, including those with very expanded and very reduced teeth. This new study examined the time at which Neanderthals and modern humans should have diverged to make the evolutionary rate of the early Neanderthals from Sima de los Huesos similar to those observed in other hominins.

377,SCIENCE,"A team of researchers has produced a record-shattering underwater sound with an intensity that eclipses that of a rocket launch. The intensity was equivalent to directing the electrical power of an entire city onto a single square meter, resulting in sound pressures above 270 decibels. The team, which included researchers from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, published their findings on April 10 in Physical Review Fluids.

Using the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), SLAC's X-ray laser, the researchers blasted tiny jets of water with short pulses of powerful X-rays. They learned that when the X-ray laser hit the jet, it vaporized the water around it and produced a shockwave. As this shockwave traveled through the jet, it created copies of itself, which formed a ""shockwave train"" that alternated between high and low pressures. Once the intensity of underwater sound crosses a certain threshold, the water breaks apart into small vapor-filled bubbles that immediately collapse. The pressure created by the shockwaves was just below this breaking point, suggesting it was at the limit of how loud sound can get underwater.

A better understanding of these trains is essential to creating new techniques that ward off damage in miniature samples that are suspended in water jets to allow their atomic-scale structure to be measured. This could advance research in areas such as biology and materials science, leading to more effective drugs and more efficient materials.

The team was led by Gabriel Blaj, a staff scientist at SLAC and Stanford University, and Claudiu Stan, at Rutgers University Newark. It also included researchers from the Stanford PULSE Institute and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. LCLS is a DOE Office of Science user facility. This work was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Science and Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division.

378,SCIENCE,"Physicists have demonstrated a new way to obtain the essential details that describe an isolated quantum system, such as a gas of atoms, through direct observation. The new method gives information about the likelihood of finding atoms at specific locations in the system with unprecedented spatial resolution. With this technique, scientists can obtain details on a scale of tens of nanometers—smaller than the width of a virus.

Experiments performed at the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), a research partnership between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Maryland, use an optical lattice—a web of laser light that suspends thousands of individual atoms—to determine the probability that an atom might be at any given location. Because each individual atom in the lattice behaves like all the others, a measurement on the entire group of atoms reveals the likelihood of an individual atom to be in a particular point in space.

Published in the journal Physical Review X, the JQI technique (and a similar technique published simultaneously by a group at the University of Chicago) can yield the likelihood of the atoms' locations at well below the wavelength of the light used to illuminate the atoms—50 times better than the limit of what optical microscopy can normally resolve.

""It's a demonstration of our ability to observe quantum mechanics,"" said JQI's Trey Porto, one of the physicists behind the research effort. ""It hasn't been done with atoms with anywhere near this precision.""

To understand a quantum system, physicists talk frequently about its ""wave function."" It is not just an important detail; it's the whole story. It contains all the information you need to describe the system.

""It's the description of the system,"" said JQI physicist Steve Rolston, another of the paper's authors. ""If you have the wave function information, you can calculate everything else about it—such as the object's magnetism, its conductivity and its likelihood to emit or absorb light.""

While the wave function is a mathematical expression and not a physical object, the team's method can reveal the behavior that the wave function describes: the probabilities that a quantum system will behave in one way versus another. In the world of quantum mechanics, probability is everything.

Among the many strange principles of quantum mechanics is the idea that before we measure their positions, objects may not have a pinpointable location. The electrons surrounding the nucleus of an atom, for example, do not travel in regular planetlike orbits, contrary to the image some of us were taught in school. Instead, they act like rippling waves, so that an electron itself cannot be said to have a definite location. Rather, the electrons reside within fuzzy regions of space.

All objects can have this wavelike behavior, but for anything large enough for unaided eyes to see, the effect is imperceptible and the rules of classical physics are in force—we don't notice buildings, buckets or breadcrumbs spreading out like waves. But isolate a tiny object such as an atom, and the situation is different because the atom exists in a size realm where the effects of quantum mechanics reign supreme. It's not possible to say with certainty where it's located, only that it will be found somewhere. The wave function provides the set of probabilities that the atom will be found in any given place.

Quantum mechanics is well-enough understood—by physicists, anyway—that for a simple-enough system, experts can calculate the wave function from first principles without needing to observe it. Many interesting systems are complicated, though.

""There are quantum systems that can't be calculated because they are too difficult,"" Rolston said—such as molecules made of several large atoms. ""This approach could help us understand those situations.""

As the wave function describes only a set of probabilities, how can physicists get a complete picture of its effects in short order? The team's approach involves measuring a large number of identical quantum systems at the same time and combining the results into one overall picture. It's sort of like rolling 100,000 pairs of dice at the same time—each roll gives a single result, and contributes a single point on the probability curve showing the values of all the dice.

What the team observed were the positions of the roughly 100,000 atoms of ytterbium the optical lattice suspends in its lasers. The ytterbium atoms are isolated from their neighbors and restricted to moving back and forth along a one-dimensional line segment. To get a high-resolution picture, the team found a way to observe narrow slices of these line segments, and how often each atom showed up in its respective slice. After observing one region, the team measured another, until it had the whole picture.

Rolston said that while he hasn't yet thought of a ""killer app"" that would take advantage of the technique, the mere fact that the team has directly imaged something central to quantum research fascinates him.

""It's not totally obvious where it will be used, but it's a new technique that offers new opportunities,"" he said. ""We've been using an optical lattice to capture atoms for years, and now it's become a new kind of measurement tool.""",Researchers shed new light on atomic 'wave function'
379,SCIENCE,"Prominent genetic ""biohacker"" Josiah Zayner is under investigation by California state officials for practicing medicine without a license.

Zayner has a background in biophysics and runs a company called The Odin, which sells do-it-yourself genetic engineering kits and other lab equipment intended for use outside of scientific laboratories. The kits and tools are intended to allow lay users to genetically modify bacteria, yeast, animals, and even humans.

The human that Zayner's products are best known for trying to modify is Zayner himself. In fact, the brazen CEO has a long history of self-experimentation. In 2016, he attempted a stomach-churning DIY fecal transplant in an airport hotel, then moved on to trying to genetically engineer his skin.

But he is perhaps best known for an alcohol-fueled stunt he livestreamed in October 2017. Between swigs of Scotch, he injected himself in the arm with what he said was the DNA for the genetic engineering tool CRISPR. The stated goal was for the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery to snip and disable Zayner's myostatin gene, which is involved with muscle-growth regulation before and after birth. Disabling the gene could leave him with beefy muscle growth.

But Zayner admitted—and outside experts agreed—that the experiment was unlikely to work. It's unclear if the genetic material made its way into Zayner's cells and, if so, how many and to what effect. Most of the research on myostatin has been done in animals.

In an interview with Buzzfeed directly after the October 2017 muscle-editing stunt, Zayner told the outlet, ""I want to live in a world where people get drunk and instead of giving themselves tattoos, they're like, 'I'm drunk, I'm going to CRISPR myself.'""

But by February of 2018, he took a sober stance. Other biohackers had begun performing similar self-injection stunts, and Zayner expressed regret. ""Honestly, I kind of blame myself,"" he told The Atlantic. ""There's no doubt in my mind that somebody is going to end up hurt eventually,"" he said. Still, Zayner has continued to sell his DIY genetic engineering kits.

The biohacking community wasn't alone in taking notice of Zayner's antics, however. Weeks after his CRISPR injection, the Food and Drug Administration weighed in, calling genetic-editing kits illegal. (Zayner had a run-in with the FDA back in 2016, too, for selling kits to brew glow-in-the-dark alcoholic beverages). In a notice about the human gene-editing kits, the FDA wrote:

Now, officials in Zayner's home state of California have also taken notice. According to a May 8, 2019, letter Zayner posted to his Instagram account on Wednesday, health investigators at the Department of Consumer Affairs are following up on a complaint alleging Zayner is practicing medicine without a license. The investigators are ""now at the point in our review where we would like to discuss this matter with you,"" it read. They requested an interview and noted, ""We will be discussing your business.""

On the social media site, Zayner responded, saying that the investigation stemmed from his ""genetic self-experimentation"" for the purpose of ""showing people how to access publicly available knowledge."" He continued:

The truth is that I have never given anyone anything to inject or use, never sold any material meant to treat a disease, and never claim to provide treatments or cures because I knew this day would come. The f***** up part is that so many people are dying not because of me but because the FDA and government refuses to allow people access to cutting-edge treatments or in some cases even basic healthcare. Yet I am the one threatened with jail.

Practicing medicine without a valid license in California can be tried as either a misdemeanor or a felony, with penalties up to a $10,000 fine and three years in prison. Zayner concluded on Twitter: ""Yeah, I need to find a lawyer.""

In a comment to Ars, Zayner added only: ""I can't believe the government is spending time investigating me when they could be helping leak spoilers to Rick & Morty season 4. Ya' know?""

380,SCIENCE,"Here, a cast from a reconstructed Neanderthal skull. Researchers just examined tooth shape among Neanderthals, humans and our close relatives to figure out when the groups diverged.

Modern humans and Neanderthals may have diverged at least 800,000 years ago, according to an analysis of nearly 1,000 teeth from humans and our close relatives.

This new estimate is much older than previous estimates based on ancient DNA analyses, which put the split between humans and Neanderthals as happening between 500,000 and 300,000 years ago.

However, while outside researchers called the new dental analysis impressive, they note that it's based on one big assumption: that tooth shape evolves in a steady fashion, especially in Neanderthals. If tooth shape doesn't evolve at a steady rate, then ""the construction of this paper collapses,"" said Fernando Ramirez Rozzi, director of research specializing in human evolution at France's National Center for Scientific Research in Toulouse, who was not involved in the study. [Photos: See the Ancient Faces of a Man-Bun Wearing Bloke and a Neanderthal Woman]

That said, it is quite possible that teeth (and Neanderthal teeth in particular) do evolve at a predictable rate, meaning the new study's calculation might be on target. ""At the moment, there is the idea of a steady evolutionary rate change in the shape of cheek-teeth,"" Ramirez Rozzi said.

The researchers examined 931 teeth belonging to a minimum of 122 individuals from eight groups, including humans and our close relatives. Of those, 164 of the teeth were from the early Neanderthals from the Sima de los Huesos (""Pit of the Bones"") site in Spain, a sample that includes almost 30 individuals that lived about 430,000 years ago, during the middle Pleistocene epoch.

By comparing the differences in tooth shape between samples, study researcher Aida Gómez-Robles, a paleoanthropologist at University College London, was able to calculate the evolutionary rates for dental shape change and then estimate the divergence time from the last common ancestor between humans and Neanderthals.

The result — that Neanderthals and modern humans probably diverged more than 800,000 years ago — shows that the last common ancestor of these two groups is probably not Homo heidelbergensis, as some scientists think.

""H. heidelbergensis cannot occupy that evolutionary position because it postdates the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans,"" Gómez-Robles told Live Science in an email. ""That means that we need to look at older species when looking for this common ancestral species.""

The finding also ""has profound implications for the way we interpret the fossil record and the evolutionary relationships between species,"" Gómez-Robles said.

Pushing back the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans ""is opening a new door"" because it suggests that the two groups were distinct for much longer than previously thought, Ramirez Rozzi said.

However, this raises a question, he said. Humans and Neanderthals interbred around 60,000 years ago, when modern humans left Africa. (This interbreeding explains why the genomes of some modern humans contain nearly 3% Neanderthal DNA.) But if humans and Neanderthals broke apart at least 800,000 years ago, it's surprising that they were still able to interbreed just 60,000 years ago, Ramirez Rozzi said.

""In other words, almost 1 million years of evolution was not enough to establish barriers (genetic, endocrinological, behavioral, etc.) to separate definitively these two species?"" he asked.

The argument is laid out well by Gómez-Robles, who is ""a well-known specialist of the Neanderthal lineage dental morphology,"" said Bruno Maureille, director of research at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), in Paris, who was not involved in the study.

But, it appears that the dental remains of Neanderthals from different pockets of Europe each have ""their own particularities,"" Maureille told Live Science. ""Can we simply try to draw such global scenarios? [I'm] not so sure.""

The study was published online May 16 in the journal Science Advances.","Humans and Neanderthals Evolved from a Mystery Common Ancestor, Huge Analysis Suggests"
381,SCIENCE,"There's a ""dark impactor"" blasting holes in our galaxy. We can't see it. It might not be made of normal matter. Our telescopes haven't directly detected it. But it sure seems like it's out there.

""It's a dense bullet of something,"" said Ana Bonaca, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who discovered evidence for the impactor.

Bonaca's evidence for the dark impactor, which she presented April 15 at the conference of the American Physical Society in Denver, is a series of holes in our galaxy's longest stellar stream, GD-1. Stellar streams are lines of stars moving together across galaxies, often originating in smaller blobs of stars that collided with the galaxy in question. The stars in GD-1, remnants of a ""globular cluster"" that plunged into the Milky Way a long time ago, are stretched out in a long line across our sky.

Under normal conditions, the stream should be more or less a single line, stretched out by our galaxy's gravity, she said in her presentation. Astronomers would expect a single gap in the stream, at the point where the original globular cluster was before its stars drifted away in two directions. But Bonaca showed that GD-1 has a second gap. And that gap has a ragged edge — a region Bonaca called GD-1's ""spur"" — as if something huge plunged through the stream not long ago, dragging stars in its wake with its enormous gravity. GD-1, it seems, was hit with that unseen bullet. [Gallery: Dark Matter Throughout the Universe]

""We can't map [the impactor] to any luminous object that we have observed,"" Bonaca told Live Science. ""It's much more massive than a star… Something like a million times the mass of the sun. So there are just no stars of that mass. We can rule that out. And if it were a black hole, it would be a supermassive black hole of the kind we find at the center of our own galaxy.""

It's not impossible that there's a second supermassive black hole in our galaxy, Bonaca said. But we'd expect to see some sign of it, like flares or radiation from its accretion disk. And most large galaxies seem to have just a single supermassive black hole at their center.

With no giant, bright objects visible zipping away from GD-1, and no evidence for a hidden, second supermassive black hole in our galaxy, the only obvious option left is a big clump of dark matter. That doesn't mean the object is definitely, 100%, absolutely made of dark matter, Bonaca said.

""It could be that it's a luminous object that went away somewhere, and it's hiding somewhere in the galaxy,"" she added.

But that seems unlikely, in part due to the sheer scale of the object.

""We know that it's 10 to 20 parsecs [30 to 65 light-years] across,"" she said. ""About the size of a globular cluster.""

But it's hard to entirely rule out a luminous object, in part because the researchers don't know how fast it was moving during the impact. (It may have been moving very fast, but not quite as heavy as expected — a true dark bullet — Bonaca said. Or it could have been moving more slowly but been very massive — a sort of dark hammer.) Without an answer to that question, it's impossible to be certain where the thing would have ended up.

Still, the possibility of having found a real dark matter object is tantalizing.

Right now, researchers don't know what dark matter is. Our universe seems to act like the luminous matter, the stuff we can see is just a small fraction of what's out there. Galaxies bind together as if there's something heavy inside them, clustered in their centers and creating enormous gravity. So most physicists reason that there's something else out there, something invisible. There are lots of different opinions as to what it's made of, but none of the efforts to directly detect dark matter on Earth have yet worked.

This dense ball of unseen something plunging through our Milky Way offers physicists a new scrap of evidence that dark matter might be real. And it would suggest that dark matter is really ""clumpy,"" as most theories about its behavior predict. [Beyond Higgs: 5 Elusive Particles That May Lurk in the Universe]

If dark matter is ""clumpy,"" then it's concentrated in irregular chunks distributed roughly across galaxies — much like the luminous matter we see concentrated in stars and nebulae. Some alternative theories, including theories that suggest dark matter doesn't exist at all, wouldn't include any clumps — and would have the effects of dark matter distributed smoothly across galaxies.

So far, Bonaca's discovery is one of a kind, so new that it hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal (though it was met appreciatively by the crowd of physicists at the prestigious conference).

To pull it off, she relied on data from the Gaia mission, an European Space Agency program to map billions of stars in our galaxy and their movements across the sky. It formed the best existing catalog of the stars that seem to be part of GD-1.

Bonaca buttressed that data with observations from the Multi Mirror Telescope in Arizona, which showed which stars were moving toward Earth, and which were moving away. That helped distinguish between stars that were really moving with GD-1, and those that just sat next to it in Earth's sky. That effort produced the most precise image ever of GD-1, which revealed the second gap, the spur, and a previously unseen region of the stellar stream.

Down the road, Bonaca said, she wants to do more mapping projects to reveal other regions of the sky where something unseen seems to be knocking stars around. The goal, she said, is to eventually map clumps of dark matter all across the Milky Way.

382,SCIENCE,"An open-source RNA analysis platform has been successfully used on plant cells for the first time—a breakthrough that could herald a new era of fundamental research and bolster efforts to engineer more efficient food and biofuel crop plants.

The technology, called Drop-seq, is a method for measuring the RNA present in individual cells, allowing scientists to see what genes are being expressed and how this relates to the specific functions of different cell types. Developed at Harvard Medical School in 2015, the freely shared protocol had previously only been used in animal cells.

""This is really important in understanding plant biology,"" said lead researcher Diane Dickel, a scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley Lab). ""Like humans and mice, plants have multiple cell and tissue types within them. But learning about plants on a cellular level is a little bit harder because, unlike animals, plants have cell walls, which make it hard to open the cells up for genetic study.""

For many of the genes in plants, we have little to no understanding of what they actually do, Dickel explained. ""But by knowing exactly what cell type or developmental stage a specific gene is expressed in, we can start getting a toehold into its function. In our study, we showed that Drop-seq can help us do this.""

""We also showed that you can use these technologies to understand how plants respond to different environmental conditions at a cellular level—something many plant biologists at Berkeley Lab are interested in because being able to grow crops under poor environmental conditions, such as drought, is essential for our continued production of food and biofuel resources,"" she said.

Dickel, who studies mammalian genomics in Berkeley Lab's Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division, has been using Drop-seq on animal cells for several years. An immediate fan of the platform's ease of use and efficacy, she soon began speaking to her colleagues working on plants about trying to use it on plant cells.

However, some were skeptical that such a project would work as easily. First off, to run plant cells through a single-cell RNA-seq analysis, they must be protoplasted—meaning they must be stripped of their cell walls using a cocktail of enzymes. This process is not easy because cells from different species and even different parts of the same plant require unique enzyme cocktails.

Secondly, some plant biologists have expressed concern that cells are altered too significantly by protoplasting to provide insight into normal functioning. And finally, some plant cells are simply too big to be put through existing single-cell RNA-seq platforms. These technologies, which emerged in the past five years, allow scientists to assess the RNA inside thousands of cells per run; previous approaches could only analyze dozens to hundreds of cells at a time.

Undeterred by these challenges, Dickel and her colleagues at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) teamed up with researchers from UC Davis who had perfected a protoplasting technique for root tissue from Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress), a species of small flowering weed that serves as a plant model organism.

After preparing samples of more than 12,000 Arabidopsis root cells, the group was thrilled when the Drop-seq process went smoother than expected. Their full results were published this week in Cell Reports.

""When we would pitch the idea to do this in plants, people would bring up a list of reasons why it wouldn't work,"" said Dickel. ""And we would say, 'ok, but let's just try it and see if it works'. And then it really worked. We were honestly surprised how straightforward it actually ended up being.""

The open-source nature of the Drop-seq technology was critical for this project's success, according to co-author Benjamin Cole, a plant genomics scientist at JGI. Because Drop-seq is inexpensive and uses easy-to-assemble components, it gave the researchers a low-risk, low-cost means to experiment. Already, a wave of interest is building. In the time leading up to their paper's publication, Dickel and her colleagues began receiving requests—from other scientists at Berkeley Lab, JGI, and beyond—for advice on how to adapt the platform for other projects.

""When I first spoke to Diane about trying Drop-seq in plants I recognized the huge potential, but I thought it would be difficult to separate plant cells rapidly enough to get useful data,"" said John Vogel, lead scientist of plant functional genomics at JGI. ""I was shocked to see how well it worked and how much they were able to learn from their initial experiment. This technique is going to be a game changer for plant biologists because it allows us to explore gene expression without grinding up whole plant organs, and the results aren't muddled by signals from the few most common cell types.""

The authors anticipate that the platform, and other similar RNA-seq technologies, will eventually become routine in plant investigations. The main hurdle, Dickel noted, will be developing protoplasting methods for each project's plant of interest.

""Part of Berkeley Lab's mission is to better understand how plants respond to changing environmental conditions, and how we can apply this understanding to best utilize plants for bioenergy,"" noted first author Christine Shulse, who is currently a JGI affiliate. ""In this work, we generated a map of gene expression in individual cell types from one plant species under two environmental conditions, which is an important first step.""",Breakthrough technique for studying gene expression takes root in plants
383,SCIENCE,"But at some point plants will get their fill of carbon, and the climate change helping hand they've extended will begin to recede. Exactly when that will happen is a question that scientists are racing to answer.

Since the Industrial Revolution began in the early 20th century, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere caused by human activity has rapidly increased. Using computer models, the study's authors concluded that photosynthesis has increased by 30 percent.

How can they tell?

Cernusak and his colleagues used data from a 2017 Nature study that measured carbonyl sulfide found in ice cores and air samples. In addition to carbon dioxide, plants take in carbonyl sulfide during their natural carbon cycle, and that is frequently used to measure photosynthesis on a global scale.

“Terrestrial plants are removing about 29 percent of our emissions that would otherwise contribute to growth of the atmospheric CO concentration. What our model analysis showed is that the role of terrestrial photosynthesis in driving this land carbon sink is larger than estimated in most other models,” says Cernusak.

Because plant absorption of carbonyl sulfide can vary by the amount of light they get, Sendall says the study's estimates “could be overestimated,” but she notes that most methods of measuring global photosynthesis have a degree of uncertainty.

“There's evidence that trees are leafier, and that there's more wood,” says Cernusak. “The wood is really where more most of the carbon is absorbed in the mass of the plant.”

Under those drastically increased CO conditions, “The makeup of their leaf tissues is a little different,” she says. “It makes it tougher for herbivores to eat and harder for larvae to grow on.”

“The response of the land carbon sink to increasing atmospheric CO remains the largest uncertainty in global carbon cycle modeling to date, and this is a huge contributor to uncertainty in climate change projections,” the Oak Ride National Laboratory notes on their website.

“More of the CO we emit will stay in the air, CO concentrations will rise quickly, and climate change will occur more rapidly,” says Danielle Way, an ecophysiologist from Western University.



What can we do?

Scientists from the University of Illinois and the Department of Agriculture have been experimenting with ways to genetically modify plants to store up even more carbon. An enzyme called rubisco is responsible for capturing CO2 for photosynthesis, and scientists want to make it more efficient.

Recent tests of modified crops have shown that beefing up rubisco increases yields by about 40 percent, but using the modified plant enzyme on a large commercial scale could take more than a decade to implement. So far tests have only been done on common crops like tobacco, and it's unclear how rubisco would alter trees, which capture the most carbon.

 In September of 2018 environmental groups met in San Francisco to devise a plan to save forests, a natural asset they say is the “forgotten climate solution.”

“I think policy makers should respond to our findings by acknowledging that the terrestrial biosphere is functioning for the moment as an efficient carbon sink,” says James Cook University’s Cernusak. “Take immediate measures to protect forests so that they can continue functioning in this way, and get to work immediately to de-carbonize our energy production.”","Plants help absorb our carbon, but for how much longer?"
384,SCIENCE,"The monstrous asteroid, dubbed by NASA Asteroid 2019 JB1, is barreling towards the Earth on a so-called “Close Approach” trajectory. NASA’s asteroid trackers have calculated a close-shave with the asteroid in the early morning hours of Monday, May 20. According to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, Asteroid JB1 will shoot past our planet around 4.23am BST (3.23am UTC). And when the asteroid nears the Earth, it will reach breakneck speeds of around 26.04km per second or 58,349.8mph.

Asteroid JB1 is an Apollo-type “Near-Earth Object” or NEO asteroid. NEOs are all asteroids and comets in orbit of the Sun at a distance of 1.3 astronomical units (au). Just one astronomical unit measures about 93 million miles (149.6 million km), which is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. NASA’s JPL estimates JB1 measures somewhere in the range of 557.7ft to 1,279.5ft (170m to 390m) across. READ MORE: Find out how often asteroids strike the Earth

An asteroid at the upper end of the estimate is taller than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The asteroid is also about 200 times longer than a Queen Size bed and 45 London double-decker buses. If the space rock were to hit the Earth, the force of impact could be cataclysmically deadly. NASA said: “If a rocky meteoroid larger than 25m but smaller than one kilometre – a little more than 1/2 miles – were to hit Earth, it would likely cause local damage to the impact area.

“We believe anything larger than one to two kilometres – one kilometre is a little more than one-half mile – could have worldwide effects.”

So, is there anything to fear from the asteroid’s flyby next week? Thankfully, NASA predicts the asteroid will not come close enough to slam into the Earth. At its closest, Asteroid JB1 will fly past Earth from a distance of 0.04305 astronomical units.

This means Asteroid will come within four million miles (6.4 million km) of our home-world. In other words, NASA expects the asteroid to fly by 16.76 times as far as the Moon is. NASA explained: “As they orbit the Sun, Near-Earth Objects can occasionally approach close to Earth. “Note that a ‘close’ passage astronomically can be very far away in human terms: millions or even tens of millions of kilometres.”","NASA asteroid tracker: A MONSTROUS 1,280FT asteroid is headed towards Earth at 58,250MPH"
385,SCIENCE,"Scientists at the University of Sheffield have discovered how genes create proteins in research which could aid the development of treatments for human diseases.

Proteins are the building blocks of life and our cells make them based on instructions from our DNA. These instructions that have to be transported from the cell nucleus, which holds the DNA, to the cytoplasm where proteins are made.

The research, led by Professor Stuart Wilson from the University of Sheffield's Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, revealed how our cells know when these instructions, known as mRNA, are ready to be transported. The findings will help our understanding of some cancers and conditions such as motor neurone disease, which are linked to faults in protein production.

The research is published today in Molecular Cell.

Professor Stuart Wilson, lead researcher from the University of Sheffield, explained: ""If the mRNA is transported before the processing is complete, then it is a disaster for the cell, which can't make proteins and ultimately dies. Faults in this process are behind many human diseases. So it's vitally important, not just that the processing is done correctly, but the cell knows when this is complete.""

The team, from the Sheffield Institute for Nucleic Acids, found that molecules known as 'export factors' - which help transport the mRNA—also signal to the cell when the processing is complete by moving their position on the mRNA.

Scientists have long argued over the position of export factors—whether they sit at the beginning of the mRNA or centrally, where the protein-making instructions have been spliced together.

Professor Wilson, working with his co-researchers Dr. Nicolas Viphakone and Dr. Ian Sudbery, found that in fact, both views are correct. The export factors initially sit at the beginning of the mRNA while the processing takes place, then once it is complete, they move further in, sitting at points where splicing has taken place, to signal that transport can begin.

""This research helps us understand a basic process that is fundamental to life, but which will enable us to develop treatments for diseases in the future,"" said Professor Wilson. ""We can't easily fix a problem until we know what's wrong and we can't know what's wrong until we're clear as to how it's supposed to work.

""Export factors have changed very little throughout evolution, so those found in humans are very similar to those in simpler organisms such as yeast and insects. Our research was in human cells, but we believe that the process we've uncovered will be pretty much the same in any animal on the planet.""

386,SCIENCE,"Scientists have demonstrated a new bio-inspired material for an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach to recovering uranium from seawater.

A research team from the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, the University of California - Berkeley, and the University of South Florida developed a material that selectively binds dissolved uranium with a low-cost polymer adsorbent. The results, published in Nature Communications, could help push past bottlenecks in the cost and efficiency of extracting uranium resources from oceans for sustainable energy production.

""Our approach is a significant leap forward,"" said coauthor Ilja Popovs of ORNL's Chemical Sciences Division. ""Our material is tailor-made for selecting uranium over other metals present in seawater and can easily be recycled for reuse, making it much more practical and efficient than previously developed adsorbents.""

Popovs took inspiration from the chemistry of iron-hungry microorganisms. Microbes such as bacteria and fungi secret natural compounds known as ""siderophores"" to siphon essential nutrients like iron from their hosts. ""We essentially created an artificial siderophore to improve the way materials select and bind uranium,"" he said.

The team used computational and experimental methods to develop a novel functional group known as ""H BHT""—2,6-bis[hydroxy(methyl)amino]-4-morpholino-1,3,5-triazine—that preferentially selects uranyl ions, or water-soluble uranium, over competing metal ions from other elements in seawater, such as vanadium.

The fundamental discovery is backed by the promising performance of a proof-of-principle H BHT polymer adsorbent. Uranyl ions are readily ""adsorbed,"" or bonded to the surface of the material's fibers because of the unique chemistry of H BHT. The prototype stands out among other synthetic materials for increasing the storage space for uranium, yielding a highly selective and recyclable material that recovers uranium more efficiently than previous methods.

With a practical recovery method, saltwater extraction offers a sustainable alternative to land-mining uranium that could sustain nuclear power production for millennia.

Uranium deposits are abundant and replenishable in seawater through the natural erosion of ore-containing rocks and soil. Despite dilute concentrations, approximately 3 milligrams of uranium per ton of seawater, the world's oceans hold massive stores of the element totaling an estimated four billion tons—a 1000 times greater supply than all land sources combined.

The development of efficient uranium adsorbents to harness this potential resource, however, has been an elusive quest since the 1960s.

""The goal is to develop efficient adsorbent materials at a low cost that can be processed using mild conditions to recover uranium, and also reused for multiple extraction cycles,"" said ORNL's Alexander Ivanov, who performed computational studies of H BHT.

Supported by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy's Fuel Cycle Research and Development program, the team has focused on determining the underlying factors that influence selectivity and increase the volume of recoverable uranium with new materials.

Previous studies on amidoxime-based compounds revealed a fundamentally stronger attraction to vanadium over uranium that may be difficult to overcome. The development of H BHT offers an alternative approach, using non-amidoxime materials, to better target uranium in mixed-metal water environments.

Selectivity has long been a stumbling block on the road to more efficient adsorbent materials. Early advances, driven by trial and error, found amidoxime-based functional groups effectively bind uranium in water but do an even better job of recovering vanadium, although the latter has a comparatively lower concentration in seawater.

""The result is that amidoxime-based materials, the current front-runners for commercially available adsorbents, fill up more quickly with vanadium than uranium, which is difficult and costly to remove,"" said Popovs.

The highly concentrated acidic solutions used to remove vanadium are an increased expense compared with mild or basic processing solutions and are burdened by caustic waste streams. Moreover, acid processing can damage material fibers, which limits their reuse, making commercial adoption cost-prohibitive.

""To work as a scaled-up concept, ideally, unwanted elements would not be adsorbed or could easily be stripped during processing and the material reused for several cycles to maximize the amount of uranium collected,"" said Popovs.

Unlike vanadium-laden materials, the H BHT polymer can be processed using mild basic solutions and recycled for extended reuse. The eco-friendly features also bring significant cost advantages to potential real-world applications.

The next step, say researchers, is to refine the approach for greater efficiency and commercial-scale opportunities.

387,SCIENCE,"Researchers at the University of Cambridge have uncovered a specialised population of skin cells that coordinate tail regeneration in frogs. These 'Regeneration-Organizing Cells' help to explain one of the great mysteries of nature and may offer clues about how this ability might be achieved in mammalian tissues.

It has long been known that some animals can regrow their tails following amputation—Aristotle observed this in the fourth century B.C. - but the mechanisms that support such regenerative potential remain poorly understood.

Using 'single-cell genomics', scientists at the Wellcome Trust/ Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute at the University of Cambridge developed an ingenious strategy to uncover what happens in different tadpole cells when they regenerate their tails.

Recent Cambridge-led advances in next-generation sequencing mean that scientists can now track which genes are turned on (being expressed) throughout a whole organism or tissue, at the resolution of individual cells. This technique, known as 'single-cell genomics', makes it possible to distinguish between cell types in more detail based on their characteristic selection of active genes.

These breakthroughs are beginning to reveal a map of cellular identities and lineages, as well as the factors involved in controlling how cells choose between alternative pathways during embryo development to produce the range of cell types in adults.

Using this technology, Can Aztekin and Dr. Tom Hiscock—under the direction of Dr. Jerome Jullien—made a detailed analysis of cell types involved in regeneration after damage in African clawed frog tadpoles (Xenopus laevis). Details are published today in the journal Science.

Dr. Tom Hiscock says: ""Tadpoles can regenerate their tails throughout their life; but there is a two-day period at a precise stage in development where they lose this ability. We exploited this natural phenomenon to compare the cell types present in tadpoles capable of regeneration and those no longer capable.""

The researchers found that the regenerative response of stem cells is orchestrated by a single sub-population of epidermal (skin) cells, which they termed Regeneration-Organizing Cells, or ROCs.

Can Aztekin says: ""It's an astonishing process to watch unfold. After tail amputation, ROCs migrate from the body to the wound and secrete a cocktail of growth factors that coordinate the response of tissue precursor cells. These cells then work together to regenerate a tail of the right size, pattern and cell composition.""

In mammals, many tissues such as the skin epidermis, the intestinal epithelium and the blood system, undergo constant turnover through life. Cell lost through exhaustion or damage are replenished by stem cells. However, these specialised cells are usually dedicated to tissue sub-lineages, while the ability to regenerate whole organs and tissues has been lost in all but a minority of tissues such as liver and skin.

Professor Benjamin Simons, a co-author of the study says: ""Understanding the mechanisms that enable some animals to regenerate whole organs represents a first step in understanding whether a similar phenomenon could be reawakened and harnessed in mammalian tissues, with implications for clinical applications.""",Scientists find new type of cell that helps tadpoles' tails regenerate
388,SCIENCE,"A group of scientists have discovered 280-million-year-old fossil tracks in a remote area of the Grand Canyon that predate the the appearance of the earliest dinosaurs, according to a press release from the Grand Canyon National Park.

According to the press release, an international team of paleontologists discovered “extremely well-preserved trackways of primitive tetrapods (four-footed animals) which inhabited an ancient desert environment.”

Paleontologists recognized the fossil tracks and say they were produced by a “long-extinct relative of very early reptiles… of extinct tetrapods known as diadectomorphs, a primitive group that possessed characteristics of both amphibians and reptiles.”

The characteristics of the newly discovered tracks suggest the creature that made the prints walked on all four legs, with each foot containing five “clawless digits.”

“Although the actual track maker for the Grand Canyon footprints may never be known, the Grand Canyon trackways preserve the travel of a very early terrestrial vertebrate,” the press release stated.

389,SCIENCE,"This story originally appeared on Undark and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Every week dozens of metal flasks arrive at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, each one loaded with air from a distant corner of the world. Research chemist Ed Dlugokencky and his colleagues in the Global Monitoring Division catalog the canisters and then use a series of high-precision tools—a gas chromatograph, a flame ionization detector, sophisticated software—to measure how much carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane each flask contains. These air samples—collected at observatories in Hawaii, Alaska, American Samoa, and Antarctica, and from tall towers, small aircraft, and volunteers on every continent—have been coming to Boulder for more than four decades, as part of one of the world’s longest-running greenhouse gas monitoring programs. The air in the flasks shows that the concentration of methane in the atmosphere had been steadily rising since 1983, before leveling off around 2000. “And then, boom, look at how it changes here,” Dlugokencky says, pointing at a graph on his computer screen. “This is really an abrupt change in the global methane budget, starting around 2007.” The amount of methane in the atmosphere has been increasing ever since. And nobody really knows why. What’s more, no one saw it coming. Methane levels have been climbing more steeply than climate experts anticipated, to a degree “so unexpected that it was not considered in pathway models preparatory to the Paris Agreement,” as Dlugokencky and several coauthors noted in a recently published paper. As the years plod on and the methane piles up, solving this mystery has taken on increasing urgency. Over a 20-year time frame, methane traps 86 times as much heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. It is responsible for about a quarter of total atmospheric warming to date. And while the steady increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are deeply worrying, they are at least conforming to scientists’ expectations. Methane is not. Methane—arguably humanity’s earliest signature on the climate—is the wild card. Humans have been producing methane for thousands of years, by clearing land with fires, raising cattle, and growing rice. Thanks to air bubbles trapped in ice cores taken from Antarctica, we know that the global average methane concentration in the atmosphere has nearly tripled in response. Because it lasts only about a decade in the atmosphere, cutting methane is a relatively fast-acting lever for slowing climate change. But it isn’t clear how we should pull that lever. Scientists continue to offer competing hypotheses to explain the global uptick, and there is no shortage of potential suspects. “The really fascinating thing about methane,” says Lori Bruhwiler, a NOAA research scientist, “is the fact that almost everything we humans do has an effect on the methane budget, from producing food to producing fuel to disposing of waste.” “And then, boom, look at how it changes here,” Dlugokencky says, pointing at a graph on his computer screen. “This is really an abrupt change in the global methane budget, starting around 2007.” Humans are directly responsible for about 60 percent of global emissions of methane. It seeps from rotting food waste in landfills, from anaerobic lagoons of pig manure, from rice paddies and exposed coal seams. Livestock belch it out as a byproduct of their digestion. It streams out of the vast metallic exoskeleton of oil and gas wells, pumping stations, pipelines, and refineries that entwine the globe. The balance comes from natural sources—wetlands, rivers and lakes, wildfires, termites, geological seeps, thawing permafrost. Wetlands are the largest single source, contributing about 30 percent of total methane emissions globally. As it happens, they are also the biggest source of uncertainty when it comes to the carbon budget, according to Benjamin Poulter, a NASA researcher and contributor to the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium of scientists that publishes one of the most widely cited estimates of the global methane budget. This uncertainty can make the debate over what’s driving the increase seem like a highly educated guessing game. “There are so many hypotheses and high-impact papers out just in the last two years that cover the whole range of explanations for why there’s this renewed growth,” Poulter says. Thanks to the careful measurements of NOAA scientists and others, we know that there are about 1,850 molecules of methane in the atmosphere for every billion molecules of air—typically shorthanded as parts per billion, or ppb—in today’s atmosphere. That’s compared to about 700 parts per billion in the pre-industrial era. But the processes behind today’s number are much less visible. It’s like knowing the final score of a game, but not who scored what and how. Getting answers is not simply an academic exercise; it’s crucial to knowing just what humanity might be facing as the planet continues to warm. “We need to have process representation to understand these mechanisms,” says Eric Kort, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan, “so we can say, for example, with certain changes to temperature and the hydrological cycle, we’d expect methane emissions to increase by X amount.” Without that understanding, Kort suggests, we’re unable to answer some important questions about what looms ahead. “Is atmospheric methane increasing as a consequence of climate change, not of our direct emissions? Are some thresholds being passed?”

Any convincing explanation needs to answer three questions. What explains the long-term increase in methane levels over the past 40 years? Why was there a pause? And why was there such an abrupt surge after 2006? Only three elements of the global methane budget are large enough to be plausible culprits: microbial emissions (from livestock, agriculture, and wetlands); fossil fuel emissions; and the chemical process by which methane is scrubbed from the atmosphere. The first theory to gain traction pinned the blame on fossil fuels, based on some suspicious timing: The use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing—a method of harvesting buried hydrocarbons that involves blasting deep layers of rock with a cocktail of water, sand, and chemicals—surged in the US oil and gas industry right around the time atmospheric methane levels shot up. Other scientists, however, are convinced that growing herds of livestock, which produce methane-rich belches and manure—are to blame. Some researchers pore over satellite data for evidence that methane production from natural sources, such as wetlands and wildfires, is changing. And still others argue that the culprit isn’t a surging source at all, but the steady, or perhaps very sudden, disappearance of a traditional methane “sink.” After an average residence time of about a decade, methane is oxidized into carbon dioxide and water vapor through chemical reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH). This atmospheric removal process may be weakening, though, possibly because OH levels are declining due to reactions with other anthropogenic pollutants. The first theory to gain traction pinned the blame on fossil fuels, based on the contemporaneous rise of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. But not everyone agrees that this is behind the methane surge. Of course, it could be a complex combination of all of these factors. Further clouding the picture, some researchers argue that the spike in concentrations isn’t really a spike at all. Rather, they say, the pause in growth from 2000 to 2006 is the true anomaly. By this reckoning, what happened in 2007 was a return to a “normal” trend of anthropogenic-driven growth, perhaps compounded by a slowdown in the chemical removal rate of methane. If so, then methane will keep on accumulating, like the water in a bathtub with an open faucet and a plugged drain. These ongoing scientific disputes reveal the problem at the heart of the methane mystery: Multiple stories can be made to neatly fit the available evidence. “Really good observations can be interpreted in ways that seem contradictory,” says Kort. To sort through it all, scientists must balance the information provided by various categories of clues. Top-down estimates are based on observations using sensors on towers, aircraft, or satellites, and models that account for the downwind transport of emissions from sources and chemical reactions with other components of the atmosphere. Bottom-up methods involve measuring emissions near the source (a gas well, landfill, even a cow’s gut) and extrapolating from those to estimate emissions at broader scales. Tracers also offer important clues. Carbon monoxide is co-emitted with methane from wildfires and biomass burning, and ethane is a hydrocarbon that’s often co-emitted with methane from oil and gas production. Methyl chloroform is an industrial solvent that, like methane, can only be removed from the atmosphere by reacting with OH; its emissions are much better known, so it’s used to infer how much OH is in the atmosphere. Researchers rely on easier-to-measure proxies to make inferences about changes in sources or sinks of methane. For instance, some have pointed to observations of increasing ethane concentrations to argue that fossil fuel extraction is the dominant driver of the methane spike. Then there are the isotopes. After being analyzed at Dlugokencky’s lab, those air samples are sent over to the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder, where their carbon isotopes are measured. “Isotopes tell you how much is coming from microbes versus old, thermogenic sources, carbon that’s been cooked by the earth,” says Bruhwiler. Methane emitted by microbial sources (also known as biogenic) tends to be lighter, with less of the carbon isotope C13 relative to C12, whereas methane from fossil fuels (thermogenic) and from burning biomass tends to be isotopically heavier. Measurements by INSTAAR and other research institutions clearly indicate that the atmosphere’s methane is becoming more depleted in the isotope C13. That can potentially winnow down the list of suspects. A methane hot spot in the American southwest — likely evidence of leakage from natural gas operations. Yet each type of clue has its limits. Recent work by Kort and others has called into question the reliability of ethane as a useful, consistent tracer of methane. Ethane-to-methane ratios vary widely across different geological basins, and the amount of ethane extracted from natural gas changes depending on its market value as a petrochemical feedstock. Not everyone is convinced by the isotope data, either. “A lot of the community is highly skeptical, because the signatures of sources cover a pretty high range,” says Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard. Some sources share the same set of isotopic fingerprints, making it hard to distinguish between certain fossil and microbial sources. “Isotopes are a useful piece of information, but I wouldn’t bet the house simply looking at the isotope data.” Bruhwiler concedes that there is uncertainty in the isotope record, and very few studies have measured the isotopes of methane from cattle and other ruminants, or bubbling out of wetlands. But she argues that isotopes of fossil fuel methane occupy a very narrow range of signatures, limited in its overlap with microbial sources. “At large global scales, the isotopic constraint should be pretty darn useful at telling us what is biogenic and what’s thermogenic,” she says.

Amidst all this uncertainty, there is one part of the global methane budget that is more clearly quantified: emissions from US oil and gas production. That’s largely thanks to the work of Steven Hamburg and the Environmental Defense Fund. In the early 2000s, Hamburg was a professor of environmental science at Brown University. For a forest ecology course he taught, he drove students out to a field site each week in a natural-gas-powered van. Later, he had an epiphany: While it seemed a cleaner, more efficient option than a gasoline-fueled vehicle, he had no idea how much gas it might be leaking. But he knew that leak rate mattered for the climate. Hamburg understood that methane was a powerful driver of near-term warming, and as an ecologist, he also knew that the rate of change in a system can be just as important as the magnitude. Despite its potency as a warming accelerator, tackling methane leaks wasn’t yet a top priority in climate policy circles. “There was an opportunity,” he says, “a large lever sitting there that people couldn’t yet see and use. We recognized that lever existed.” When he became the chief scientist of EDF in 2008, he started asking around for data on oil and gas supply-chain leaks. “I got a standard reply from companies: ‘We’ve got it covered, we know what’s going on, it’s fine.’ As I poked around, there was no good data that anyone could show me to back that up.” In 2012, EDF launched a program to support the in-depth study of methane leaks throughout the US oil and gas supply chain. The effort has brought together more than 140 scientists from over 40 different academic and research institutions, yielding more than 30 peer-reviewed publications and a much more finely grained understanding of how much methane leaks, and where, from fossil fuel extraction throughout the country. The culminating piece of research, published in Science last July, drew on ground-based measurements and observations from aircraft to estimate that methane emissions from the sector are 60 percent higher than estimates from inventories maintained by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. That figure amounts to a leak rate of 2.3 percent of total natural gas production in the US. A leak rate of just 4 percent would cancel out the climate benefits of burning gas instead of coal to generate electricity. At the global scale, though, data on fugitive oil and gas emissions remains sparse. For example, there are few measurements of, and very little research access to, gas fields in Russia and Iran. Years ago, Hamburg chatted with Harvard atmospheric scientist Steven Wofsy about the problem. What level of spatial granularity, they mused, would be needed to see and pinpoint leaks from oil and gas fields and large facilities from space? That’s how MethaneSAT was born. Last year EDF announced that it would build and launch its very own methane-hunting satellite. “The metaphor I often use,” says Hamburg, “is we’re trying to get away from a handcrafted small-factory model, and we need to go to mass production. It’s too expensive and labor-intensive to deploy scientific teams [at the global scale].” Today, Wofsy is the science lead on the project. With a chuckle, he concedes it’s an extremely ambitious, “bonkers” undertaking—an environmental nonprofit trying to pull off a NASA-scale project. “EDF is very strategic,” he says, with admiration. “Their goal is to transform the oil and gas industry in the entire world by 2025.” Recent work by Stanford researchers suggests that more than half the volume of all methane emissions from natural gas comes from just the largest 5 percent of leaks. Even if the actual number is somewhat lower, there is wide agreement among researchers that tackling these “super-emitters” could be the most cost-effective methane reduction strategy. But first you have to find those plumes. MethaneSAT will be hunting for leaks over oil and gas fields that might amount to just 10 parts per billion, against a background of 1,850. “So you’re looking for about 0.5 percent. If you’re going to measure 0.5 percent, you have to have precision of about 0.1 percent,” Wofsy says. “And some people think you can’t do that. We think we can—not at every point in the field but at a regional scale.” Another unprecedented feature of MethaneSAT is that the data it captures will be made publicly accessible. “Our product is change in the oil and gas industry, and what motivates that change is transparent information about what they emit,” says Wofsy. Of course, the satellite is still on the drawing board, and many technical hurdles loom. Even if everything goes according to plan, MethaneSAT won’t start producing actionable data until late in 2022. Still, there’s some evidence it may already be having a focusing effect in some corners of the industry. Fiji George, the head of climate and sustainability at Cheniere Energy, the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in the US, has had a long career in the sector, including stints at Shell Oil and Southwestern Energy. “Once you have this satellite technology,” George says, “in 2022 Steve Hamburg could come along and say, ‘Hey, this facility, we mapped it every 14 minutes and found loads of emissions.’ Without knowing whether it’s permitted emissions or a maintenance event or a stochastic event—that creates more uncertainty and concern and pressure on industry.” If the technical challenges can be overcome, George sees new methane-detection technologies as something the industry should embrace if it wants natural gas to have a place in the energy mix decades from now, and in a world that takes the Paris climate targets seriously. “If this is successful, five years from now we’ll have a very different prospect in terms of being able to understand what’s driving these changes” in global methane, says Wofsy. “Then someone could build another one for half the cost and use it for a different mission. You could start to go after the agriculture sources, landfills, the wetlands. You could look at any of them.” While there is no definitive indictment yet, the community of methane detectives seems to be getting closer to ruling out one key suspect. “The attribution that was pretty popular a few years ago was increasing natural gas,” says Daniel Jacob, citing the combination of isotopic evidence and atmospheric inversion models by his group and others. “That’s gotten the wind knocked out of its sails a bit. We really don’t see evidence for that.” “My personal feeling is that the evidence is strongly pointing to a natural biogenic source behind the increase.” Some researchers, such as Robert Howarth of Cornell, remain convinced that fugitive emissions from oil and gas production—especially fracking—are systematically underestimated, and likely to be behind the global spike. “It’s a compelling narrative,” says Pep Canadell, executive director of the Global Carbon Project, “but the larger community does not support that view.” In an influential 2016 paper in Nature, a large group of scientists led by Stefan Schwietzke, a former NOAA scientist who now works for EDF, pulled together the largest set of long-term data on isotopes from all methane sources—microbial, fossil fuels, biomass burning. They found that fossil fuel methane emissions were at least 60 percent greater than previous best estimates, but were not increasing over time. It’s a counterintuitive point of arrival. Oil and gas leaks aren’t responsible for the global uptick, yet they are a much bigger problem than previously thought. And plugging them remains one of the most feasible ways to cut methane. The International Energy Agency estimates that as much as 50 percent of all oil and gas methane leaks could be fixed at zero net cost.

Even as suspicions shift away from fossil fuels, they are coalescing around tropical wetlands, the biggest global source of methane. “When methane started going up, shortly after that, C13 started going down,” says Dlugokencky. Whatever is driving the increasing concentrations “has to be a source of methane that’s lighter than the average mix of emissions to the atmosphere. What could do that? Microbial sources like wetlands or ruminant animals.” Tropical wetlands may be the only source big and dynamic enough to explain both the magnitude and suddenness of the spike. It’s unlikely that the numbers of livestock, the other big biogenic source, have increased fast enough to account for it. Methane production from wetlands, however, can change rapidly from year to year, in response to meteorological shifts. Microbes in wetlands might be producing more methane in response to increased precipitation, or warmer temperatures, or both. Or wetlands might be growing in area, inundating more and more land surface, whether due to El Niño events or other climatic variables. “Wetlands is the ultimate potential carbon-climate feedback that we don’t fully understand,” says Canadell. Scientists agree that models of these processes are getting better but still need a lot more work. To map the distribution of wetlands, researchers have relied on old aeronautical charts of questionable accuracy, says Bruhwiler. They also use satellite images to identify areas that are inundated on land, but those are of limited use in the tropics, where overlying vegetation and heavy cloud cover can mask standing water. And scientists still know very little about the various isotopic signatures of microbial methane from wetlands. In the long-term, EDF-led collaborative effort to study oil and gas leaks, Eric Kort sees a potential research road map for tackling these sources of uncertainty. “This series of targeted studies looking at oil and gas basins at a number of scales have improved our understanding of emissions and the processes that control that,” he says. “The same measurement approaches can be used to improve our understanding of wetlands.” “My personal feeling is that the evidence is strongly pointing to a natural biogenic source behind the increase,” says Bruhwiler. “And if this is true, that’s important, because it may be an indication that there is a climate feedback going on between the natural terrestrial biosphere and warming.” As the world warms, and parts of it get wetter, will microbes in tropical wetlands cough up even more methane? Will the ones hibernating in the Arctic permafrost release more of that vast store of frozen carbon as methane than carbon dioxide, spurring further warming? Such runaway-train feedback mechanisms are the elements of the global climate system that keep scientists awake at night. “The most important science question we face now is the question of carbon-climate feedbacks,” says Bruhwiler. “The question that’s really important is, what’s coming down the road?” That’s why solving the methane mystery matters. Looking for human fingerprints on these “natural” methane sources will help us understand what the future might hold. Yet even if new detection tools definitively identify wetlands as the main driver, our task would remain the same: in addition to rapidly cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, reduce methane emissions as far and fast as possible, from those sources we can control. Despite all the arguments over what’s driving the increase since 2007, says Kort, “over longer time frames there isn’t any debate. It’s driven by human activities. In the last 40 years, the rise over that period is solely best described by anthropogenic emissions. Those statements are not really controversial.” “The main thing we stress, while we sort through this scientific debate,” says Hamburg, “is that it doesn’t in any way reduce the ability to mitigate methane from particular sources, and to understand their impact on the climate.” That means aggressively finding and fixing leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, he says. It also means transforming the way we grow, consume, and dispose of food, Pep Canadell emphasizes. Two new studies published in February seem to reinforce the urgency of plugging leaks. In their recent paper, Dlugokencky and colleagues concluded that, regardless of whether it’s due to a changing sink or changing tropical wetlands, the renewed growth in methane scrambles plans to meet the target of staying below two degrees of warming over preindustrial levels—the target agreed to by nations gathered in Paris in 2015. Methane’s wild climb leaves much less room—and less time—in our global emissions budget than we expected to have. Another new study, however, offers some measure of hope, citing modeling that shows that reducing anthropogenic methane emissions can still offset the “natural” leakage that the thawing Arctic will produce under warmer temperatures. If true, it would suggest that a disastrous feedback loop—in which human-driven greenhouse gas emissions melt the planet’s permafrost, turning it from a vast carbon storage unit into a huge new source of planet-warming methane, driving further warming—might yet be averted. But scientists also say the time available for avoiding that runaway-train scenario is quickly disappearing. “The bottom line,” says Canadell, “is that methane is going up, and it doesn’t look like that will stop anytime soon.”

390,SCIENCE,"Iron-based superconductors (IBSCs) have attracted sustained research attention over the past decade, partly because new IBSCs were discovered one after another in the earlier years. At present, however, exploration of IBSCs becomes more and more challenging. A research team from Zhejiang University developed a structural design strategy for exploration from which they succeeded in finding a series of hole-doped IBSCs with double FeAs layers in recent years. Nevertheless, the electron-doped analogue has not been realized until now.

The newly discovered electron-doped IBSC is BaTh Fe As (N O ) , an intergrowth compound of un-doped BaFe As and electron-doped ThFeAsN O (see the inset of Figure 1). The new superconductor could be synthesized only when nitrogen is partially replaced with oxygen as in the case of BaTh Fe As (N O ) .

Namely, the oxygen-free phase, BaTh Fe As N , could not be prepared due to lattice matching. The realized synthetic process is actually a redox reaction, BaFe As + 2ThFeAsN O = BaTh Fe As (N O ) , which indicates an essential role of inter-block charge transfer for stabilizing the intergrowth structure. Note that, while both the constituent structural blocks share identical iron atoms, they contain crystallographically different arsenic atoms, as a consequence of the charge transfer.

Although the new superconductor is isostructural to the previous ""12442-type"" ones, it shows contrasting structural and physical properties. First, the structural details in the FeAs layers are different from those of hole-doped 12442-type IBSCs, but similar to most electron-doped IBSCs. Second, the Hall-effect measurement shows negative Hall coefficient in the whole temperature range, and the Hall coefficient values are consistent with the electron doping level due to the oxygen substitution. Third, the superconducting properties such as the upper critical fields and specific-heat jump are close to most electron-doped IBSCs.

The onset resistive transition temperature of the new double-FeAs-layer IBSC is 30 K, and the zero-resistance temperature is 22 K. Correspondingly, the magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat data suggest two transitions, and the bulk superconductivity appears at 22 K. The result is in contrast with the single-FeAs-layer counterpart, ThFeAsN O , with the same doping level. The latter does not show superconductivity above1.8 K.

The essential role of inter-block charge transfer demonstrated seems to be insightful, which could be helpful for the exploration of broader layered materials beyond the layered IBSCs.

391,SCIENCE,"Scientists say that something mysterious punched gigantic, cosmic ""bullet holes"" in parts of the Milky Way.

There's a string of holes in a long stream of stars called GD-1 that suggests that some yet-undiscovered thing blasted its way through, according to research presented to the American Physical Society last month.

Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Ana Bonaca, the scientist who discovered the cosmic crime scene, suspects that the gigantic ""bullet holes"" may have been carved out by invisible dark matter.

Unfortunately, the culprit of this celestial shooting seems to have gotten away with it - Bonaca told Live Science that there's no evidence at the crime scene beyond the size of the gaps in the stellar stream.

""We can't map [the impactor] to any luminous object that we have observed,"" Bonaca told Live Science.

""It's much more massive than a star… Something like a million times the mass of the Sun. So there are just no stars of that mass. We can rule that out. And if it were a black hole, it would be a supermassive black hole of the kind we find at the center of our own galaxy.""

Because there's no evidence of such a black hole, Bonaca suspects a ball of dark matter may have crashed through the stars. But it's too early to definitively rule out any possibilities.

""It's a dense bullet of something,"" Bonaca said.

392,SCIENCE,"Far below Bermuda's pink sand beaches and turquoise tides, geoscientists have discovered the first direct evidence that material from deep within Earth's mantle transition zone -- a layer rich in water, crystals and melted rock -- can percolate to the surface to form volcanoes.

Scientists have long known that volcanoes form when tectonic plates (traveling on top of the Earth's mantle) converge, or as the result of mantle plumes that rise from the core-mantle boundary to make hotspots at Earth's crust. But obtaining evidence that material emanating from the mantle's transition zone -- between 250 to 400 miles (440-660 km) beneath our planet's crust -- can cause volcanoes to form is new to geologists.

""We found a new way to make volcanoes. This is the first time we found a clear indication from the transition zone deep in the Earth's mantle that volcanoes can form this way,"" said senior author Esteban Gazel, associate professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. The research published in Nature.

""We were expecting our data to show the volcano was a mantle plume formation -- an upwelling from the deeper mantle -- just like it is in Hawaii,"" Gazel said. But 30 million years ago, a disturbance in the transition zone caused an upwelling of magma material to rise to the surface, forming a now-dormant volcano under the Atlantic Ocean and then forming Bermuda.

Using a 2,600-foot (over 700-meter) core sample -- drilled in 1972, housed at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia -- co-author Sarah Mazza of the University of Münster, in Germany, assessed the cross-section for isotopes, trace elements, evidence of water content and other volatile material. The assessment provided a geologic, volcanic history of Bermuda.

""I first suspected that Bermuda's volcanic past was special as I sampled the core and noticed the diverse textures and mineralogy preserved in the different lava flows,"" Mazza said. ""We quickly confirmed extreme enrichments in trace element compositions. It was exciting going over our first results ... the mysteries of Bermuda started to unfold.""

From the core samples, the group detected geochemical signatures from the transition zone, which included larger amounts of water encased in the crystals than were found in subduction zones. Water in subduction zones recycles back to Earth's surface. There is enough water in the transition zone to form at least three oceans, according to Gazel, but it is the water that helps rock to melt in the transition zone.

The geoscientists developed numerical models with Robert Moucha, associate professor of Earth sciences at Syracuse University, to discover a disturbance in the transition zone that likely forced material from this deep mantle layer to melt and percolate to the surface, Gazel said.

Despite more than 50 years of isotopic measurements in oceanic lavas, the peculiar and extreme isotopes measured in the Bermuda lava core had not been observed before. Yet, these extreme isotopic compositions allowed the scientists to identify the unique source of the lava.

""If we start to look more carefully, I believe we're going to find these geochemical signatures in more places,"" said co-author Michael Bizimis, associate professor at the University of South Carolina.

Gazel explained that this research provides a new connection between the transition zone layer and volcanoes on the surface of Earth. ""With this work we can demonstrate that the Earth's transition zone is an extreme chemical reservoir,"" said Gazel. ""We are now just now beginning to recognize its importance in terms of global geodynamics and even volcanism.""

Said Gazel: ""Our next step is to examine more locations to determine the difference between geological processes that can result in intraplate volcanoes and determine the role of the mantle's transition zone in the evolution of our planet.""

In addition to Gazel, Mazza, Bizimis and Moucha, co-authors of ""Sampling the Volatile-Rich Transition Zone Beneath Bermuda,"" are Paul Béguelin, University of South Carolina; Elizabeth A. Johnson, James Madison University; Ryan J. McAleer, United States Geological Survey; and Alexander V. Sobolev, the Russian Academy of Sciences.

393,SCIENCE,"When stars explode and die, they tend to swallow and incinerate everything around them. But sometimes exoplanets survive, left to drift the galaxy as celestial orphans.

Now, a team of astronomers from the U.S. and Europe determined which planets are most likely to survive the deaths of the white dwarf stars they orbit, according to research published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Small, dense, and distant exoplanets have the best odds, according to the research, which could help astronomers pinpoint even more planets in the remote cosmos.

The scientists simulated these destructive events and found a direct link between survival and exoplanet size and density. The big, loosely-packed units of the pack were obliterated by their dying stars while the tiny, dense exoplanets survived, as long as they were orbiting at least one-third as far from their stars as Mercury is from the Sun.

“Our study prompts astronomers to look for rocky planets close to — but just outside of — the destruction radius of the white dwarf,” University of Warwick physicist Dimitri Veras said in a university-published press release. “So far observations have focused on this inner region, but our study demonstrates that rocky planets can survive tidal interactions with the white dwarf in a way which pushes the planets slightly outward.”

394,SCIENCE,"A small satellite designed to hunt for new planets beyond the solar system recently looked down at Earth to capture an image of California's ""City of Stars.""

The greater Los Angeles area stands out in these images from ASTERIA, the Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics, a satellite not much larger than a briefcase. ASTERIA is a CubeSat, or a small satellite composed of cubic units that measure 10 centimeters (4.5 inches) on each side. This particular CubeSat is made up of six units.

The images, taken March 29, reveal a massive grid of illuminated city streets and freeways. A bright spot near the center of the first image marks the location of Dodger Stadium. (The Dodgers played the Arizona Diamondbacks at home that night.) To the northeast, near the darkness of the San Gabriel Mountains, is NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built and operates ASTERIA, and the nearby Rose Bowl Stadium. The close-cropped image shows a region of about 43.5 square miles (70 square kilometers), with a resolution of about 100 feet (30 meters) per pixel.

Lots of orbiting small satellites can take higher-quality pictures of Earth than this one. But ASTERIA is the only CubeSat in orbit that can also look for exoplanets, or planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. Its primary mission objective was to demonstrate precision-pointing technology in a small satellite.

With precision pointing, ASTERIA can stare at a star for long periods of time and measure small changes in its brightness. A slight decrease in a star's brightness as detected by ASTERIA could indicate that a planet is orbiting the star and passed in front of the star. This is called a planet transit. (NASA missions that use or have used the transit method to find exoplanets include the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which launched in 2018, and the recently retired Kepler space telescope.) ASTERIA took these images of Los Angeles in order to further explore the capabilities of its onboard hardware.

ASTERIA met its primary mission requirements - demonstrating that the spacecraft could point very precisely - by January 2018. Now ASTERIA is operating in an extended mission phase that includes conducting exoplanet science and testing new software capabilities.

Engineers will test an onboard navigation system that could enable the satellite to autonomously determine its own orbit using only ASTERIA's imaging system. This will establish whether a CubeSat system has the capability to navigate by itself in a low-Earth orbit environment in which GPS services are unavailable or ground communication is intermittent.

ASTERIA was developed under the Phaeton Program at JPL. Phaeton provided early-career hires, under the guidance of experienced mentors, with the challenges of a flight project. The mission is a collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge.

The team’s findings, published Thursday in Current Biology, confirmed that bedbugs originated at least 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed Earth. The discovery upends the established timeline of bedbug evolution, and could help to anticipate the pest’s next moves in an era of climate change and expansive human activity.

396,SCIENCE,"On Saturday, April 20, something bad happened to SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship. We still don't know exactly what happened. But at least we now know more than we did last month.

Eyewitness accounts at the time of the event referred to ""smoke"" seen over the Florida coast. NASA and SpaceX released statements referring to an ""anomaly."" News outlets reported an explosion. Eventually, a leaked video of the incident showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon spaceship on its test stand suddenly erupting into a ball of flame.

Initially, SpaceX and NASA declined to give much information on the anomaly, the smoke, or especially the explosion. But ultimately, that leaked video must have persuaded SpaceX and NASA to tear the bandage off and confirm what many already expected: Crew Dragon blew up.

It's hard to argue with a video

In a public statement last week, SpaceX vice president of mission assurance Hans Koenigsmann described how, while situated on a test stand in Florida, Crew Dragon had successfully test-fired its Draco maneuvering thrusters twice. It was just preparing to fire its Super Draco thrusters (which, in the event of a mishap with the spaceship's rocket booster, would be used to safely propel the spaceship and its crew away from the explosion), when all of a sudden, ""there was an anomaly and the vehicle was destroyed.""

Now even Koenigsmann's statement repeated the party line that it was ""too early to confirm"" what exactly happened. Still, here's what we know that's important for investors.

The spaceship that blew up last month was the same vessel that successfully completed an unmanned docking with the International Space Station in March. This spaceship, as you will recall, splashed down at sea after completing its mission -- so it's possible April's accident had something to do with wear and tear (and seawater) on the vessel, and not a fault in the spacecraft's initial design.

SpaceX was planning to reuse this particular spaceship to conduct an ""in-flight abort test"" in June, launching Crew Dragon atop a rocket, then igniting its Super Draco thrusters to demonstrate the ability to rapidly propel the capsule away from a (hypothetical) exploding rocket. Successful completion of that test would have permitted the company to launch astronauts to ISS as early as July, in a mission dubbed Demo-2.

But due to the April anomaly, it's now likely that both the June in-flight abort test, and by extension the July launch attempt, will have to be postponed. For one thing, SpaceX will definitely have to build a new spaceship now. (Several are under construction , but that will still take time.) Some experts are saying the ISS mission could slip into 2020, and even Koenigsmann admits that the accident was ""not good news for the schedule.""

What it means for investors

Although SpaceX rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) has suffered delays and setbacks of its own in getting its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft ready for test flights, it's still expected to launch its first unmanned Starliner on a trial run to ISS in August. If that goes well, a manned mission could follow as early as November . With SpaceX now potentially seeing its first manned mission delayed into 2020, this seems to shift Boeing into the lead in this race. Boeing may very well win bragging rights as the company that returns American astronauts to space, aboard an American spaceship, for the first time since the shuttle program was shut down in 2011.

Such a success (if it happens) would tend to validate NASA's decision to pay Boeing $4.2 billion to run six transport missions to ISS aboard Starliner, versus awarding SpaceX only $2.6 billion for the same work.

397,SCIENCE,"Trees, from the mighty redwoods to slender dogwoods, would be nothing without their microbial sidekicks. Millions of species of fungi and bacteria swap nutrients between soil and the roots of trees, forming a vast, interconnected web of organisms throughout the woods. Now, for the first time, scientists have mapped this “wood wide web” on a global scale, using a database of more than 28,000 tree species living in more than 70 countries.

“I haven’t seen anybody do anything like that before,” says Kathleen Treseder, an ecologist at the University of California, Irvine. “I wish I had thought of it.”

Before scientists could map the forest’s underground ecosystem, they needed to know something more basic: where trees live. Ecologist Thomas Crowther, now at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, gathered vast amounts of data on this starting in 2012, from government agencies and individual scientists who had identified trees and measured their sizes around the world. In 2015, he mapped trees’ global distribution and reported that Earth has about 3 trillion trees.

Inspired by that paper, Kabir Peay, a biologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, emailed Crowther and suggested doing the same for the web of underground organisms that connects forest trees. Each tree in Crowther’s database is closely associated with certain types of microbes. For example, oak and pine tree roots are surrounded by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi that can build vast underground networks in their search for nutrients. Maple and cedar trees, by contrast, prefer arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), which burrow directly into trees’ root cells but form smaller soil webs. Still other trees, mainly in the legume family (related to crop plants such as soybeans and peanuts), associate with bacteria that turn nitrogen from the atmosphere into usable plant food, a process known as “fixing” nitrogen.

The researchers wrote a computer algorithm to search for correlations between the EM-, AM-, and nitrogen-fixer–associated trees in Crowther’s database and local environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil chemistry, and topography. They then used the correlations found by the algorithm to fill in the global map and predict what kinds of fungi would live in places where they didn’t have data, which included much of Africa and Asia.

Local climate sets the stage for the wood wide web, the team reports today in . In cool temperate and boreal forests, where wood and organic matter decay slowly, network-building EM fungi rule. About four in five trees in these regions associate with these fungi, the authors found, suggesting the webs found in local studies indeed permeate the soils of North America, Europe, and Asia.

By contrast, in the warmer tropics where wood and organic matter decay quickly, AM fungi dominate. These fungi form smaller webs and do less intertree swapping, meaning the tropical wood wide web is likely more localized. About 90% of all tree species associate with AM fungi; the vast majority are clustered in the hyperdiverse tropics. Nitrogen fixers were most abundant in hot, dry places such as the desert of the U.S. Southwest.

Charlie Koven, an Earth system scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, applauds what he says is the first global forest microbe map. But he wonders whether the authors missed some important factors that also shape the underground world. Hard-to-measure processes such as nutrient and gas loss from the soil could affect where different microbes live; if so, the study’s predictions could be less accurate, he says.

Despite such uncertainties, having the first hard numbers for which tree-associated microbes live where will be “very useful,” Treseder says. The findings could, for example, help researchers build better computer models to predict how much carbon forests will squirrel away and how much they will spew into the atmosphere as the climate warms, she says.

Crowther, however, is ready to make a prediction now. His results suggest that as the planet warms, about 10% of EM-associated trees could be replaced by AM-associated trees. Microbes in forests dominated by AM fungi churn through carbon-containing organic matter faster, so they could liberate lots of heat-trapping carbon dioxide quickly, potentially accelerating a climate change process that is already happening at a frightening pace.

That argument is “a little bit more tenuous” to Treseder. She says scientists are still puzzling out how different soil fungi interact with carbon. But, she adds, “I’m willing to be convinced.”",‘Wood wide web’—the underground network of microbes that connects trees—mapped for first time
398,SCIENCE,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — When the results of the third phase of NASA’s 3D-Printed Mars Habitat Challenge were revealed in Peoria, Illinois, in early May, Penn State fell just short of besting its friendly rival AI SpaceFactory. But in the process, the team engineered a breakthrough that moves forward 3D-printing construction research and pushes the team closer to the goal of creating sustainable housing on Earth.

For just more than two years, Penn State Den@Mars, an interdisciplinary team composed of students and faculty representing the Colleges of Arts and Architecture, Engineering, and Agricultural Sciences, and the Materials Research Institute, has been competing in NASA’s ambitious challenge that calls on entrants to develop advanced 3D-printing technology to produce a structurally sound habitat that can be printed by NASA space explorers on Mars and beyond. And things have been going quite well.

The second-place finish in the final stage of phase three of the competition, which required the two remaining teams to 3D-print a one-third scale habitat, earned the Penn State team $200,000, bringing its competition earnings to $500,000.

Along with the winnings, the team has received grant money from Penn State as well as in-kind contributions of materials and consultation from Autodesk, Gulf Concrete Technologies, and Tilcon. The support has pushed the team to tackle the numerous challenges that its design presented, which included printing a fully enclosed structure — something that has never been accomplished in 3D-printed home construction research, according to Jose Duarte, Stuckeman Chair in Design Innovation in the College of Arts and Architecture.

To learn more about how Penn State researchers are developing 3D-printed building technology, visit impact.psu.edu.

The team’s habitat design features a cylindrical base completed with a dome-style roof concept that requires the 3D-printing robotic arm to add layers of paste-like concrete that inch closer to the center of the structure, resulting in a pointed roof that fully encloses the structure.

With nearly 200 spectators gathered at Caterpillar’s Edwards Demonstration and Learning Center in Peoria, the two teams competed side by side for five days, culminating with the final print of each team’s structure.

AI SpaceFactory was ahead for much of the three days dedicated to printing, but on the final day, and as the 6 p.m. deadline to complete the structure approached, Penn State moved ahead and finished printing with just 11 minutes left. In a dramatic attempt to finish, AI tried to prematurely place the prefabricated skylight on top of the structure and it fell to the ground due to a lack of support. The mishap stunned onlookers, and following an audible gasp, Penn State looked to be in control of the competition.

“The atmosphere was exciting and lively. It was much like a football game,” Duarte said. “Each team was ahead at different points and we felt the pressure. But when their roof collapsed, we knew our design, which we didn’t have time to fully test before the final print, could win.”

With the pressure of the moment behind them, team members took a moment to celebrate their success, knowing their structure had made history.

“Printing an enclosed roof has never been done before,” Duarte said. “It was an amazing feeling and the success really highlighted the collaborative nature of the team. We had big dreams and because of everyone involved, they became a reality.”

After each team’s structure was completed, they underwent rigorous strength testing. The habitats were hit with a small wrecking ball and ultimately crumbled under the pressure of a Caterpillar backhoe that slowly pressed on the top of the structures with its bucket.

Although the Penn State team engineered a breakthrough in 3D-printing, AI SpaceFactory narrowly won the phase-three competition and moved one step closer to winning the challenge. But even in defeat, the team returned to Happy Valley one step closer to the intended goal of the research, which is to develop 3D-printed home construction technology that could impact homelessness or help to rebuild areas ravaged by natural disaster.

Mars is almost 34 million miles from earth, but the need for sustainable building on our home planet is becoming greater as factors such as climate change become more prevalent, according to Shadi Nazarian, associate professor of architecture.

“We definitely feel a sense of social responsibility with this research,” Nazarian said. “Imagine an area that was devastated by a tornado; this type of technology could be sent to that area and shelters can be immediately printed for those who lost everything. This thinking drives our research and feels much more attainable with our latest achievement.”

To showcase the concept, the team is working with Penn State to identify an area on campus where a 3D-printed tiny house could be constructed. Similar to the MorningStar Solar Home, the building will be fully sustainable and offer a glimpse into the future of home construction.

As those plans develop, the team will continue its intensive research in an effort to refine its design for the NASA challenge, which will resume next year.","3D-printed Mars habitat team has breakthrough, finishes second in NASA challenge | Penn State University"
399,SCIENCE,"English peasants in Medieval times lived on a combination of meat stews, leafy vegetables and dairy products which scientists say was healthier than modern diets.

Food residue inside 500-year-old pottery at the medieval town of West Cotton in Northamptonshire revealed the eating habits of normal folk.

They would have dined on bread and so-called 'white meats' - a term used by peasants which included butter and various cheeses.

Poor people couldn't afford finer delicacies like fish but the presence of oats and barley proves they had access to carbohydrates, likely in the form of bread.

Cooking pots had their contents analysed using chemical and isotopic techniques to find evidence relating to the contents of their diet.

Experts from the University of Bristol identified lipids, fats, oils and natural waxes from the ceramics.

They found the surprisingly well-rounded diet of the peasants would have kept them well-fed and adequately nourished.

Dr Julie Dunne at the University of Bristol told MailOnline: 'The medieval peasant had a healthy diet and wasn't lacking in anything major!

'It is certainly much healthier than the diet of processed foods many of us eat today.

'The meat stews (beef and mutton) with leafy vegetables (cabbage, leek) would have provided protein and fibre and important vitamins and the dairy products (butter and 'green' cheeses) would also have provided protein and other important nutrients.

'These dairy products were sometimes referred to as the ""white meats"" of the poor, and known to have been one of the mainstays of the medieval peasants diet.

'There was also a bakehouse on the site and we also found plant remains of oats and barley - these would have provided carbohydrate.

'The barley was probably used to make bread and oats may have been added to stews to make ""pottages"" and ""bulk"" them out.'

A range of historical documents and accounts were also examined for the study, which is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

But the researchers say that before their study there was little direct evidence to support this.

The history books instead record the lavish banquets of the elite and depict members of the royal family hosting dinner parties.

The lack of knowledge about what the majority of the population survived on stands in stark contrast.

Dr Dunne said: 'All too often in history the detail, for example food and clothing, of the everyday life of ordinary people is unknown.

'Traditionally, we focus on the important historical figures as these are the people discussed in ancient documents.

'Much is known of the medieval dietary practices of the nobility and ecclesiastical institutions, but less about what foods the medieval peasantry consumed.'

The researchers also looked at butchery techniques, methods of food preparation and rubbish disposal at West Cotton.

But the researchers say that before their study there was little direct evidence to support this.

Dr Dunne added: 'Food and diet are central to understanding daily life in the medieval period, particularly for the medieval peasant.

'This study has provided valuable information on diet and animal husbandry by medieval peasants and helped illustrate agricultural production, consumption and economic life in one of England's early medieval villages.'","Medieval peasants lived on a diet of meat, vegetables and cheese"
400,SCIENCE,"May 16 (UPI) -- Scientists have discovered a new type of volcano formation.

While studying the planet's layers deep beneath Bermuda, scientists found evidence of volcanic material rising from the mantle's transition zone, located 250 to 400 miles beneath Earth's crust.

""We found a new way to make volcanoes,"" Esteban Gazel, an associate professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell University, said in a news release. ""This is the first time we found a clear indication from the transition zone deep in the Earth's mantle that volcanoes can form this way.""

The new research -- detailed this week in the journal Nature -- is based on the analysis of a 600-foot core sample drilled in Bermuda in 1972. For the last several decades, the massive cylinder of rock and sediment has been stored at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.

To figure out where the island's ancient volcanic material came from, geologists analyzed the isotopes of various trace elements, as well as the amount of water and other volatile materials trapped in the rocky layers.

Scientists were expecting to trace the ancient magma to a much deeper source. Most mantle plumes, like those fueling the Hawaiian volcanoes, rise from the core-mantle boundary.

The geochemical signals found within the core pointed elsewhere, however.

Scientists determined the now-dormant volcano that created Bermuda formed after a disturbance in the mantle's transition zone caused some volatile-rich material to begin percolating toward the surface around 30 million years ago.

The tremendous amount of water trapped inside the ancient core's crystals was the main giveaway. The mantle's transition zone holds enough water to form three oceans.

In addition to large amounts of water, scientists also found strange combinations of extreme isotopes -- isotopic signatures never seen before. But now that scientists know what a volcano derived from the mantle's transition zone looks like, they expect to find similar geochemical signatures among ancient rock layers.

""With this work we can demonstrate that the Earth's transition zone is an extreme chemical reservoir,"" Gazel said. ""We are now just now beginning to recognize its importance in terms of global geodynamics and even volcanism.""

Gazel and his colleagues are now working to determine what role this new type of volcanism played in the evolution of the planet.",Geologists find new way volcanoes form from material in mantle's transition zone
401,SCIENCE,"While bed bugs have been tormenting humanity for millennia, it’s long been assumed their evolutionary journey as parasites first began tens of millions of years ago, when they fed on bats. But an international team of scientists has found evidence suggesting the origin of these vampiric insects extends even further into the past—back to the heyday of dinosaurs.



When people think about bed bugs, they’re probably thinking about the common bed bug, or Cimex lectularius. But there are actually over 100 known insect species closely related to our bed bug, falling under the umbrella of the Cimicidae family. These bugs, broadly known as cimicids, all need to feed on the blood of a host. Most species can really only survive off a single host species, but some can choose between a roster of fleshy eateries.

The leading theory is that the very first ancient bed bugs colonized ancient bats. That would put the start of their evolutionary branch, at most, sometime around 50 million to 60 million years ago. But the authors of this current study, published Thursday in Current Biology, say they’ve collected enough evidence that suggests a much older provenance.

Their case includes a genetic analysis of existing bed bug species that feed on birds and bats from a wide variety of bed bug sub-groups, scrounged up over a 15-year-span from caves and museums, as well as fossil evidence of an ancient cimicid-like insect that was preserved in amber more than 100 million years ago (its discovery was documented in 2002). This fossilized insect probably isn’t the direct ancestor of cimicids today, but its close genetic relationship to the family helped the authors work out a timeline for the ancestral insect that would give rise to the bed bug.

Based on all of this evidence, they estimated this proto-bed bug first appeared sometime around 122 million years ago, with the lineage that would directly lead to bed bugs emerging sometime around 100 million years ago. This far predates the currently assumed origin of bats, and places them right in the Cretaceous period.

According to Warren Booth, a molecular ecologist at the University of Tulsa who studies bed bug evolution but is unaffiliated with this research, the team’s case is robust. And if they’re right, then bed bugs would be one of the most astonishing success stories this planet has ever seen.

“So put more easily, the asteroid that hit the Earth leading to the mass extinction event (known as the K-Pg mass extinction), was around 66 million years ago. So, bed bugs are older than that, and they lived through it. But, let’s go back further... T. rex appeared on the Earth around 77 million years, So, bed bugs were on this Earth before T. rex evolved,” Booth told Gizmodo via email. “To me, that is a pretty remarkable image.”

Funny as the idea of T. rex straining to scratch its bed bug bites would be, dinosaurs probably never hosted these ancient bed bugs, the authors noted. Even if dinosaurs were warm-blooded, as today’s bed bug hosts all are, they’re not thought to have lived or slept in any one place for too long. Bed bugs are terrifying, sure, but they’re also slow-moving and need a home base near their prey to make a living.

Aside from moving the starting point of bed bug evolution back, the authors say their findings may also overturn other common assumptions about the bed bug.

They found evidence, for instance, that bed bug species have rarely evolved from an incarnation that infested many types of animals to one that sticks to a single host. Evolutionarily speaking, it’s thought that parasites tend to switch from a wide array of hosts to a single one because it’s more resource-efficient. But that doesn’t seem to be true for bed bugs. More often than not, bed bugs just switched from one single host to another, such as from birds to bats. Since most bed bugs today have specialized hosts, it’s unlikely that ancient bed bugs were any different, the authors said. But it’s still unclear what that animal might have been if it wasn’t bats.

“What that was is pure speculation, but to me, I think some of the arboreal ancestral birds, or possibly some of the arboreal mammal-like creatures [could be a possibility]” Booth said. “Will we ever know what the true ancestral host was? That’s unlikely, but we now know that it lived before T. rex, and that’s pretty amazing.”

Human-biting bed bugs seem to be an exception to this general rule, though. According to the authors, all three species that plague us evolved from bed bugs that used to only feed on a single host, but today these bugs can still feed on the blood of other animals (namely bats) if the opportunity presents itself. The findings also appear to throw a wrench into another theory about our personal history with bed bugs.

The bed bug species that feed on humans likely split off into their own branches quite a while before modern humans arrived (somewhere up to 2 million years ago). In other words, the bugs that now call us dinner already existed by the time we started living in caves and near bats—they just chomped onto a good opportunity when they saw it. That said, while the common bed bugs that feed on us are genetically similar to their cousins that still live in caves or attics and mainly feed on bats, and can even interbreed in the lab, the two groups are slowly evolving away from one another.

“Ultimately, this is a very intriguing story that completely upends our understanding of the evolution of this lineage,” Booth said.

More than anything else, the findings highlight just how resilient bed bugs have been. Even human ingenuity hasn’t knocked the common bed bug down for long. The pesticides we developed in the mid-20th century nearly wiped them out, but they’ve staged a global comeback in recent decades, thanks to mutations that made them almost impervious to these chemicals. And while the authors say their research should help us learn how to better manage these pests, it’s tough to imagine that they won’t find a way to bounce back from anything we throw at them.

402,SCIENCE,"As cosmologists and astrophysicists delve deeper into the darkest recesses of the universe, their need for increasingly powerful observational and computational tools has expanded exponentially. From facilities such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to supercomputers like Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Cori system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) facility, they are on a quest to collect, simulate, and analyze increasing amounts of data that can help explain the nature of things we can't see, as well as those we can.

Toward this end, gravitational lensing is one of the most promising tools scientists have to extract this information by giving them the ability to probe both the geometry of the universe and the growth of cosmic structure. Gravitational lensing distorts images of distant galaxies in a way that is determined by the amount of matter in the line of sight in a certain direction, and it provides a way of looking at a two-dimensional map of dark matter, according to Deborah Bard, Group Lead for the Data Science Engagement Group in Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).

""Gravitational lensing is one of the best ways we have to study dark matter, which is important because it tells us a lot about the structure of the universe,"" she said. ""The majority of matter in the universe is dark matter, which we can't see directly, so we have to use indirect methods to study how it is distributed.""

But as experimental and theoretical datasets grow, along with the simulations needed to image and analyze this data, a new challenge has emerged: these simulations are increasingly—even prohibitively—computationally expensive. So computational cosmologists often resort to computationally cheaper surrogate models, which emulate expensive simulations. More recently, however, ""advances in deep generative models based on neural networks opened the possibility of constructing more robust and less hand-engineered surrogate models for many types of simulators, including those in cosmology,"" said Mustafa Mustafa, a machine learning engineer at NERSC and lead author on a new study that describes one such approach developed by a collaboration involving Berkeley Lab, Google Research, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

A variety of deep generative models are being investigated for science applications, but the Berkeley Lab-led team is taking a unique tack: generative adversarial networks (GANs). In a paper published May 6, 2019 in Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology, they discuss their new deep learning network, dubbed CosmoGAN, and its ability to create high-fidelity, weak gravitational lensing convergence maps.

""A convergence map is effectively a 2-D map of the gravitational lensing that we see in the sky along the line of sight,"" said Bard, a co-author on the Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology paper. ""If you have a peak in a convergence map that corresponds to a peak in a large amount of matter along the line of sight, that means there is a huge amount of dark matter in that direction.""

Why opt for GANs instead of other types of generative models? Performance and precision, according to Mustafa.

""From a deep learning perspective, there are other ways to learn how to generate convergence maps from images, but when we started this project GANs seemed to produce very high-resolution images compared to competing methods, while still being computationally and neural network size efficient,"" he said.

""We were looking for two things: to be accurate and to be fast,"" added co-author Zaria Lukic, a research scientist in the Computational Cosmology Center at Berkeley Lab. ""GANs offer hope of being nearly as accurate compared to full physics simulations.""

The research team is particularly interested in constructing a surrogate model that would reduce the computational cost of running these simulations. In the Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology paper, they outline a number of advantages of GANs in the study of large physics simulations.

""GANs are known to be very unstable during training, especially when you reach the very end of the training and the images start to look nice—that's when the updates to the network can be really chaotic,"" Mustafa said. ""But because we have the summary statistics that we use in cosmology, we were able to evaluate the GANs at every step of the training, which helped us determine the generator we thought was the best. This procedure is not usually used in training GANs.""

Using the CosmoGAN generator network, the team has been able to produce convergence maps that are described by—with high statistical confidence—the same summary statistics as the fully simulated maps. This very high level of agreement between convergence maps that are statistically indistinguishable from maps produced by physics-based generative models offers an important step toward building emulators out of deep neural networks.

""The huge advantage here was that the problem we were tackling was a physics problem that had associated metrics,"" Bard said. ""But with our approach, there are actual metrics that allow you to quantify how accurate your GAN is. To me that is what is really exciting about this—how these kinds of physics problems can influence machine learning methods.

Ultimately such approaches could transform science that currently relies on detailed physics simulations that require billions of compute hours and occupy petabytes of disk space—but there is considerable work still to be done. Cosmology data (and scientific data in general) can require very high-resolution measurements, such as full-sky telescope images.

""The 2-D images considered for this project are valuable, but the actual physics simulations are 3-D and can be time-varying ?and irregular, producing a rich, web-like structure of features,"" said Wahid Bhmiji, a big data architect in the Data and Analytics Services group at NERSC and a co-author on the Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology paper. ""In addition, the approach needs to be extended to explore new virtual universes rather than ones that have already been simulated—ultimately building a controllable CosmoGAN.""

""The idea of doing controllable GANs is essentially the Holy Grail of the whole problem that we are working on: to be able to truly emulate the physical simulators we need to build surrogate models based on controllable GANs,"" Mustafa added. ""Right now we are trying to understand how to stabilize the training dynamics, given all the advances in the field that have happened in the last couple of years. Stabilizing the training is extremely important to actually be able to do what we want to do next.""",CosmoGAN: Training a neural network to study dark matter
403,SCIENCE,"NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter hit a dizzying milestone this morning: It completed 60,000 loops around the Red Planet at 10:39 a.m. PDT (1:39 p.m. EDT). On average, MRO takes 112 minutes to circle Mars, whipping around at about 2 miles per second (3.4 kilometers per second).

Since entering orbit on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft has been collecting daily science about the planet's surface and atmosphere, including detailed views with its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera (HiRISE). HiRISE is powerful enough to see surface features the size of a dining room table from 186 miles (300 kilometers) above the surface.

Meanwhile, MRO is watching the daily weather and probing the subsurface for ice, providing data that can influence the designs of future missions that will take humans to Mars.

But MRO isn't just sending back its own science; it serves in a network of relays that beam data back to Earth from NASA's Mars rovers and landers. Later this month, MRO will hit another milestone: It will have relayed 1 terabit of data, largely from NASA's Curiosity rover. If you've ever enjoyed one of Curiosity's selfies or sprawling landscapes or wondered at its scientific discoveries, MRO probably helped make them possible.

""MRO has given scientists and the public a new perspective of Mars,"" said Project Manager Dan Johnston at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the mission. ""We've also supported NASA's fleet of Mars surface missions, allowing them to send their images and discoveries back to scientists on Earth.""

While rovers and landers can study only their immediate vicinity, orbiters can view wide swaths of the entire planet; MRO can actually target any point on the Martian globe approximately once every two weeks.

MRO's aerial perspective also provides scientists a complementary view of a dynamic planet. As seasons change, they can see avalanches and cloud patterns. HiRISE has imaged CO ice sublimating, migrating sand dunes and meteorite strikes reshaping the landscape. With its Mars Climate Sounder instrument and its Mars Color Imager camera, MRO can also study atmospheric events like the massive global dust storm that proved fatal to NASA's Opportunity rover in 2018.

""Mars is our laboratory,"" said MRO Deputy Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of JPL. ""After more than a decade, we've collected enough data to formulate and test hypotheses to see how they change or hold up over time.""

MRO is one of several orbiters that send data from Mars to Earth each day. The same way MRO is the primary relay for Curiosity, Odyssey (NASA's longest-lived orbiter) is the primary relay for the agency's latest Martian inhabitant, InSight. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter recently started changing its orbit in preparation to cover the Mars 2020 rover's entry after it lands in February 2021. After data is sent up to an orbiter, it's beamed to giant antennas at one of three locations around Earth, all of which are part of NASA's Deep Space Network.

That relay network is now international. The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter has been carrying an ever-increasing share of data sent from the surface. And all of these orbiters are preparing for the arrival of ESA's Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to land the same year as Mars 2020.

Orbiters like MRO and Odyssey are snap-happy, constantly imaging potential landing sites for future missions. But after a site has been selected and a mission is sent to Mars, orbiters play another critical role.

Before a surface mission can begin conducting science, it has to land safely. Successful landings require clocklike precision so that the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere at just the right angle, the parachute opens at the right time and sensors detect the rapidly approaching surface.

MRO and other orbiters serve as black boxes, recording data about each landing, which grow more difficult with the sort of added mass that comes with a mission like Mars 2020. Engineers use the data to design safer missions - which will be key to sending astronauts to Mars. With plans to return astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024, NASA is looking ahead at humans exploring the Red Planet, too.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

404,SCIENCE,"A magnified view of a triangle weaver spider ( Hyptiotes cavatus ). Notice how there is silk bunched at its back legs and another strand in its front legs. Once prey lands in its web, the spider releases the silk at its back leg, which causes it to hurl forward like a slingshot.

Does the idea of a spider using its web to catapult itself at high speeds give you the willies? Then be forewarned: the triangle weaver spider (Hyptiotes cavatus) does just that. Which makes it the only known creature, besides humans, to employ a strategy known as ""external power amplification, a new study finds.

The concept of external power amplification is simple. Basically, an animal uses an external device (in this case, the spider's web) to store energy, like a person storing energy in a bow with a pulled-back arrow. Once the energy is released, the spider is flung forward like a slingshot, greatly exceeding the speeds at which the arachnid could otherwise travel.

This crafty trick helps the spider survive. The triangle weaver spider doesn't have venom, so it uses this slingshot method to help it swiftly catch prey that land on its web, the researchers said. [Goliath Birdeater: Images of a Colossal Spider]

To study the critter, the scientists collected wild triangle weaver spiders, which are native to the United States and Canada, and brought them to the lab, where the spiders were housed in terrariums and filmed with high-speed videos as they hunted prey.

The videos revealed that after the spider builds a triangular web, it retreats to the web's corner, where the long lines of its web join together. Then it takes the web's anchor line, the main strand that connects the web to something stable, like a branch, and cuts the line in two.

Then, the spider does its trick: it uses its body to bridge the now-loose, cut strand of web. It holds the far end (the end closest to the branch) with its hind legs and the front end with its front legs. Next, the spider walks backward ""in a 'leg-over-leg' motion, pulling the web taut,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

As the spider walks backward, it's essentially storing energy in the web, much like a little kid pulling back a slingshot. The spider can wait like this for hours. Then, when the spider feels a stimulus on itself or the web, it lets go of the rear anchor line and shoots forward with alarming speed.

""All of that stored elastic energy causes a recoil and it [the spider and the web] just flings forward, kind of like when you let go of the rubber band,"" said study co-researcher Daniel Maksuta, a doctoral student studying polymer science at the University of Akron in Ohio. ""It really works out too. [If] the prey is massive in comparison to the web and the spider, the web kind of just flings around it. So, that's how [the prey] gets all tangled up.""

The maneuver is so fast, the spider can be hurled forward at accelerations of about 2,535 feet/second squared (772 meters/s^2), the researchers found.

""The spider and the web move a lot before the prey really starts moving,"" Maksuta told Live Science. In other words, the prey doesn't even know what hit it, and by the time it does, it's too late.

The tiny spider then works to ensnare the prey with more iterations of this slingshot method until the hapless victim is completely wrapped in silk. All of this is done without the spider having to get close to the prey, which protects the eight-legged critter from possible injury.

""It's pretty good at catching prey without having to touch it, unlike a lot of spiders,"" Maksuta said.

Other animals use power amplification, but it's usually powered by their own muscles, meaning it isn't external like the spider's. Classic examples of this are the jumping mechanisms of fleas, froghopper insects and frogs; the deadly strike of the mantis shrimp; and the tongue projection of chameleons, the researchers wrote in the study.

""We can't really underestimate the technological advancements of organisms,"" Maksuta said. ""They're creative.""

The study was published online May 13 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

405,SCIENCE,"Reproducible scientific results are not always true and true scientific results are not always reproducible, according to a mathematical model produced by University of Idaho researchers. Their study, which simulates the search for that scientific truth, will be published Wednesday, May 15, in the journal PLOS ONE.

Independent confirmation of scientific results—known as reproducibility—lends credibility to a researcher's conclusion. But researchers have found the results of many well-known science experiments cannot be reproduced, an issue referred to as a ""replication crisis.""

""Over the last decade, people have focused on trying to find remedies for the 'replication crisis,'"" said Berna Devezer, lead author of the study and U of I associate professor of marketing in the College of Business and Economics. ""But proposals for remedies are being accepted and implemented too fast without solid justifications to support them. We need a better theoretical understanding of how science operates before we can provide reliable remedies for the right problems. Our model is a framework for studying science.""

Devezer and her colleagues investigated the relationship between reproducibility and the discovery of scientific truths by building a mathematical model that represents a scientific community working toward finding a scientific truth. In each simulation, the scientists are asked to identify the shape of a specific polygon.

The modeled scientific community included multiple scientist types, each with a different research strategy, such as performing highly innovative experiments or simple replication experiments. Devezer and her colleagues studied whether factors like the makeup of the community, the complexity of the polygon and the rate of reproducibility influenced how fast the community settled on the true polygon shape as the scientific consensus and the persistence of the true polygon shape as the scientific consensus.

Within the model, the rate of reproducibility did not always correlate with the probability of identifying the truth, how fast the community identified the truth and whether the community stuck with the truth once they identified it. These findings indicate reproducible results are not synonymous with finding the truth, Devezer said.

Compared to other research strategies, highly innovative research tactics resulted in a quicker discovery of the truth. According to the study, a diversity of research strategies protected against ineffective research approaches and optimized desirable aspects of the scientific process.

Variables including the makeup of the community and complexity of the true polygon influenced the speed scientists discovered the truth and persistence of that truth, suggesting the validity of scientific results should not be automatically blamed on questionable research practices or problematic incentives, Devezer said. Both have been pointed to as drivers of the ""replication crisis.""

""We found that, within the model, some research strategies that lead to reproducible results could actually slow down the scientific process, meaning reproducibility may not always be the best—or at least the only—indicator of good science,"" said Erkan Buzbas, U of I assistant professor in the College of Science, Department of Statistical Science and a co-author on the paper.

407,SCIENCE,"A 24-tonne dinosaur may have walked in a ‘high-heeled’ fashion, according to University of Queensland research.

UQ PhD candidate Andréas Jannel and colleagues from UQ’s Dinosaur Lab analysed fossils of Australia’s only named Jurassic sauropod, Rhoetosaurus brownei, to better understand how such an enormous creature could support its own body weight.

“Looking at the bones of the foot, it was clear that Rhoetosaurus walked with an elevated heel, raising the question: how was its foot able to support the immense mass of this animal, up to 40 tonnes?” Mr Jannel said.

“Our research suggests that even though Rhoetosaurus stood on its tiptoes, the heel was cushioned by fleshy pad.”

“We see a similar thing in elephant feet, but this dinosaur was at least five times as heavy as an elephant, so the forces involved are much greater.”

Mr Jannel and his colleagues arrived at this conclusion by creating a replica of the fossil, and then physically manipulating it in an attempt to understand the movement between bones.

“We also used 3D modelling techniques to assess the different foot postures that would have allowed Rhoetosaurus to support its weight,” he said.

“Finally, we looked at a range of sauropod footprints from around the world, many of which indicated the presence of a fleshy heel pad behind the toes, supporting what the bones were telling us.

“The addition of a cushioning pad that supports the raised heel appears to be a key innovation during the evolution of sauropods, and probably appeared in early members of the group some time during the Early to Middle Jurassic Periods.

“The advantages of a soft tissue pad may have helped facilitate the trend towards the enormous body sizes we see in these dinosaurs.”

The fossils of the specimen R. brownei were found near Roma in southwest Queensland and are dated to 160–170 million years ago, when Australia was part of the supercontinent of Gondwana.

Mr Jannel is now using computer techniques to simulate how different foot postures and the presence of a soft tissue pad affect stress distributions within the bones.

“In a nutshell, I’m using engineering tools to apply theoretical forces on the bones, assessing how stress is distributed within the feet of these giant dinosaurs, with the aim to provide mechanical evidence for the presence of such a soft tissue pad.

“It can be a tedious and time-consuming process, but I’ve always been fascinated by palaeontology, particularly the link between form and function in extinct animals,” he said.

“There’s so much more to know, but it’s amazing to discover that becoming ‘high-heeled’ might have been an important step in the evolution of sauropod dinosaurs.”

The research is published in the Journal of Morphology (DOI: 10.1002/jmor.20989).

408,SCIENCE,"Which came first, the pigs or the pioneers? In Barbados, that has been a historical mystery ever since the first English colonists arrived on the island in 1627 to encounter what they thought was a herd of wild European pigs.

A recent discovery by an SFU archaeologist is shedding new light on the matter. Christina Giovas uncovered the jaw bone of a peccary, a South American mammal that resembles a wild pig, while researching a larger project on prehistoric animal introductions in the Caribbean.

""I didn't give it much notice at the time, but simply collected it along with other bones,"" says Giovas, the lead author of a study just published in PLOS ONE. ""It was completely unexpected and I honestly thought I must have made a mistake with the species identification.""

Giovas and collaborators George Kamenov and John Krigbaum of the University of Florida radiocarbon-dated the bone and conducted strontium isotope analysis to determine the age and whether the peccary was born on Barbados or had been imported from elsewhere.

The results showed the peccary was local and dated to 1645-1670, when the English wrote their account of finding wild European pigs on the Caribbean island. The researchers were not only able to show there had been a previously undetected historic peccary introduction but that the region's earliest celebrated maps depicted peccaries that had been mistaken for pigs by the English.

Giovas says the findings upend Barbados' accepted colonial history and reflect how quickly Europeans began to alter New World environments by altering species distributions.

""Checking historical and archaeological records, we determined the most likely source of peccary introduction was from Spanish or Portuguese ships passing the island in the 16th century -- and most likely left as a source of meat for future visiting sailors,"" she says.",True identity of imposter 'pigs' on 17th century map overturns early colonial history of Barbados
409,SCIENCE,"Glass found in the Egyptian desert was created by a meteorite impact around 29 million years ago, unravelling a riddle almost a century in the making.

Researchers believe that the origin of the so-called Libyan Desert Glass scattered across the Saharan desert in Egypt and Libya formed when an asteroid exploded in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Glass forms naturally when molten material cools so quickly that the molecules can't settle into an ordered structure, like a crystal.

The glass has been found in ancient jewellery, including a scarab carved from the material which features in pectoral jewellery buried beside Tutankhamun.

Previous studies have claimed that the tiny greenish-yellow fragments were caused by an atmospheric air burst when asteroids, or Near Earth Objects, explode and shoot particles through the Earth's atmosphere.

They say that the resulting airblast would have washed over the Egyptian desert, dumping vast amounts of heat into the sand.

The researchers, from Curtin University in Australia, examined the tiny grains of the mineral zircon in samples of the glass, which is found over several thousand square kilometres in western Egypt.

Zircons in the glass preserved evidence of the former presence of a high-pressure mineral named reidite, which only forms during a meteorite impact.

'It has been a topic of ongoing debate as to whether the glass formed during meteorite impact, or during an airburst,' said Aaron Cavosie, from Curtin University, who led the study.

'Both meteorite impacts and airbursts can cause melting, however, only meteorite impacts create shock waves that form high-pressure minerals.'

Mr Cavosie said that finding evidence of former reidite confirms it was created as the result of a meteorite impact.

The idea that the glass may have formed during a large atmospheric airburst gained popularity after a dramatic airburst over Russia in 2013.

The airburst caused extensive property damage and injury to humans but did not cause surface materials to melt.

'Previous models suggested that Libyan desert glass represented a large, 100-megatonnes (Mt) class airburst, but our results show this is not the case,' Mr Cavosie said.

'Meteorite impacts are catastrophic events, but they are not common.

'Airbursts happen more frequently, but we now know not to expect a Libyan desert glass-forming event in the near future, which is cause for some comfort,' he said.

The findings could help scientists understand the possible threat posed by potential asteroid strikes.

The findings were published in the journal Geology.",Yellow glass in Egyptian desert was created when an asteroid struck

Dairy products such as cheese also played an important role.

Dr Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol, said: “All too often in history the detail, for example food and clothing, of the everyday life of ordinary people is unknown.

“Traditionally, we focus on the important historical figures as these are the people discussed in ancient documents.

“Much is known of the medieval dietary practices of the nobility and ecclesiastical institutions, but less about what foods the medieval peasantry consumed.”

One has a thick poisonous atmosphere, one has hardly any atmosphere at all, and one is just right for life to flourish – but it wasn’t always that way. The atmospheres of our two neighbors Venus and Mars can teach us a lot about the past and future scenarios for our own planet.

Rewind 4.6 billion years from the present day to the planetary construction yard, and we see that all the planets share a common history: they were all born from the same swirling cloud of gas and dust, with the newborn sun ignited at the center. Slowly but surely, with the help of gravity, dust accumulated into boulders, eventually snowballing into planet-sized entities.

Rocky material could withstand the heat closest to the sun, while gassy, icy material could only survive further away, giving rise to the innermost terrestrial planets and the outermost gas and ice giants, respectively. The leftovers made asteroids and comets.

The atmospheres of the rocky planets were formed as part of the very energetic building process, mostly by outgassing as they cooled down, with some small contributions from volcanic eruptions and minor delivery of water, gases and other ingredients by comets and asteroids. Over time the atmospheres underwent a strong evolution thanks to an intricate combination of factors that ultimately led to the current status, with Earth being the only known planet to support life, and the only one with liquid water on its surface today.

We know from space missions such as ESA’s Venus Express, which observed Venus from orbit between 2006 and 2014, and Mars Express, investigating the red planet since 2003, that liquid water once flowed on our sister planets, too. While the water on Venus has long since boiled away, on Mars it is either buried underground or locked up in ice caps. Intimately linked to the story of water – and ultimately to the big question of whether life could have arisen beyond Earth – is the state of a planet’s atmosphere. And connected to that, the interplay and exchange of material between the atmosphere and oceans, and the planet’s rocky interior.

Back at our newly formed planets, from a ball of molten rock with a mantle surrounding a dense core, they started to cool down. Earth, Venus and Mars all experienced outgassing activity in these early days, which formed the first young, hot and dense atmospheres. As these atmospheres also cooled, the first oceans rained down from the skies.

At some stage, though, the characteristics of the geological activity of the three planets diverged. Earth’s solid lid cracked into plates, in some places diving below another plate in subduction zones, and in other places colliding to create vast mountain ranges or pulling apart to create giant rifts or new crust. Earth’s tectonic plates are still moving today, giving rise to volcanic eruptions or earthquakes at their boundaries.

Venus, which is only slightly smaller than Earth, may still have volcanic activity today, and its surface seems to have been resurfaced with lavas as recently as half a billion years ago. Today it has no discernible plate tectonics system; its volcanoes were likely powered by thermal plumes rising through the mantle – created in a process that can be likened to a “lava lamp” but on a gigantic scale.

Mars, being a lot smaller, cooled off more quickly than Earth and Venus, and when its volcanoes became extinct it lost a key means of replenishing its atmosphere. But it still boasts the largest volcano in the entire solar system, the 16 mile (25 km) high Olympus Mons, likely too the result of continuous vertical building of the crust from plumes rising from below. Even though there is evidence for tectonic activity within the last 10 million years, and even the occasional marsquake in present times, the planet is not believed to have an Earth-like tectonics system either.

It is not just global plate tectonics alone that make Earth special, but the unique combination with oceans. Today our oceans, which cover about two-thirds of Earth’s surface, absorb and store much of our planet’s heat, transporting it along currents around the globe. As a tectonic plate is dragged down into the mantle, it warms up and releases water and gases trapped in the rocks, which in turn percolate through hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.

Extremely hardy lifeforms have been found in such environments at the bottom of Earth’s oceans, providing clues as to how early life may have begun, and giving scientists pointers on where to look elsewhere in the solar system: Jupiter’s moon Europa, or Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus for example, which conceal oceans of liquid water beneath their icy crusts, with evidence from space missions like Cassini suggesting hydrothermal activity may be present.

Moreover, plate tectonics helps to modulate our atmosphere, regulating the amount of carbon dioxide on our planet over long timescales. When atmospheric carbon dioxide combines with water, carbonic acid is formed, which in turn dissolves rocks. Rain brings the carbonic acid and calcium to the oceans – carbon dioxide is also dissolved directly in oceans – where it is cycled back into the ocean floor. For almost half of Earth’s history the atmosphere contained very little oxygen. Oceanic cynobacteria were the first to use the sun’s energy to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, a turning point in providing the atmosphere that much further down the line allowed complex life to flourish. Without the planetary recycling and regulation between the mantle, oceans and atmosphere, Earth may have ended up more like Venus.

Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth’s evil twin on account of it being almost the same size but plagued with a thick noxious atmosphere and a sweltering 470ºC (878 F) surface. Its high pressure and temperature is hot enough to melt lead – and destroy the spacecraft that dare to land on it. Thanks to its dense atmosphere, it is even hotter than planet Mercury, which orbits closer to the sun. Its dramatic deviation from an Earth-like environment is often used as an example of what happens in a runaway greenhouse effect.

The main source of heat in the solar system is the sun’s energy, which warms a planet’s surface up, and then the planet radiates energy back into space. An atmosphere traps some of the outgoing energy, retaining heat – the so-called greenhouse effect. It is a natural phenomenon that helps regulate a planet’s temperature. If it weren’t for greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and ozone, Earth’s surface temperature would be about 30 degrees cooler than its present 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees C) average.

Over the past centuries, humans have altered this natural balance on Earth, strengthening the greenhouse effect since the dawn of industrial activity by contributing additional carbon dioxide along with nitrogen oxides, sulphates and other trace gases and dust and smoke particles into the air. The long-term effects on our planet include global warming, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. The consequences of a warming climate are far-reaching, potentially affecting freshwater resources, global food production and sea level, and triggering an increase in extreme-weather events.

There is no human activity on Venus, but studying its atmosphere provides a natural laboratory to better understand a runaway greenhouse effect. At some point in its history, Venus began trapping too much heat. It was once thought to host oceans like Earth, but the added heat turned water into steam, and in turn, additional water vapor in the atmosphere trapped more and more heat until entire oceans completely evaporated. Venus Express even showed that water vapor is still escaping from Venus’ atmosphere and into space today.

Venus Express also discovered a mysterious layer of high-altitude sulphur dioxide in the planet’s atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is expected from the emission of volcanoes – over the mission’s duration Venus Express recorded large changes in the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere. This leads to sulphuric acid clouds and droplets at altitudes of about 31-44 miles (50-70 km) – any remaining sulphur dioxide should be destroyed by intense solar radiation. So it was a surprise for Venus Express to discover a layer of the gas at around 62 miles (100 km). It was determined that evaporating sulphuric acid droplets free gaseous sulphuric acid that is then broken apart by sunlight, releasing the sulphur dioxide gas.

The observation adds to the discussion what might happen if large quantities of sulphur dioxide are injected into Earth’s atmosphere – a proposal made for how to mitigate the effects of the changing climate on Earth. The concept was demonstrated from the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, when sulphur dioxide ejected from the eruption created small droplets of concentrated sulphuric acid – like those found in Venus’ clouds – at about 12 miles (20 km) altitude. This generated a haze layer and cooled our planet globally by about .9 degrees Fahrenheit (.5 degrees C) for several years. Because this haze reflects heat it has been proposed that one way to reduce global temperatures would be to inject artificially large quantities of sulphur dioxide into our atmosphere. However, the natural effects of Mount Pinatubo only offered a temporary cooling effect. Studying the enormous layer of sulphuric acid cloud droplets at Venus offers a natural way to study the longer term effects; an initially protective haze at higher altitude would eventually be converted back into gaseous sulphuric acid, which is transparent and allows all the sun’s rays through. Not to mention the side-effect of acid rain, which on Earth can cause harmful effects on soils, plant life and water.

Our other neighbor, Mars, lies at another extreme: although its atmosphere is also predominantly carbon dioxide, today it hardly has any at all, with a total atmospheric volume less than 1 percent of Earth’s.

Mars’ existing atmosphere is so thin that although carbon dioxide condenses into clouds, it cannot retain sufficient energy from the sun to maintain surface water – it vaporizes instantly at the surface. But with its low pressure and relatively balmy temperatures of -67 degrees Fahrenheit (-55 degrees C) – ranging from -207.4 degrees Fahrenheit (-133 degrees C) at the winter pole to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees C) during summer, spacecraft don’t melt on its surface, allowing us greater access to uncover its secrets. Furthermore, thanks to the lack of recycling plate tectonics on the planet, four-billion-year-old rocks are directly accessible to our landers and rovers exploring its surface. Meanwhile our orbiters, including Mars Express, which has been surveying the planet for more than 15 years, are constantly finding evidence for its once flowing waters, oceans and lakes, giving a tantalizing hope that it might have once supported life.

The red planet too would have started out with a thicker atmosphere thanks to the delivery of volatiles from asteroids and comets, and volcanic outgassing from the planet as its rocky interior cooled down. It simply couldn’t hold on to its atmosphere most likely because of its smaller mass and lower gravity. In addition, its initial higher temperature would have given more energy to gas molecules in the atmosphere, allowing them to escape more easily. And, having also lost its global magnetic field early in its history, the remaining atmosphere was subsequently exposed to the solar wind – a continuous flow of charged particles from the sun – that, just as on Venus, continues to strip away the atmosphere even today.

With a decreased atmosphere, the surface water moved underground, released as vast flash-floods only when impacts heated the ground and released the subsurface water and ice. It is also locked up in the polar ice caps. Mars Express also recently detected a pool of liquid water buried within 1.24 miles (2 km) of the surface. Could evidence of life also be underground? This question is at the heart of Europe’s ExoMars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020 and land in 2021 to drill up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) below the surface to retrieve and analyze samples in search for biomarkers.

Mars is thought to be currently coming out of an ice age. Like Earth, Mars is sensitive to changes in factors such as the tilt of its rotational axis as it orbits the sun; it is thought that the stability of water at the surface has varied over thousands to millions of years as the axial tilt of the planet and its distance from the sun undergo cyclical changes. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, currently investigating the red planet from orbit, recently detected hydrated material in equatorial regions that could represent former locations of the planet’s poles in the past.

The Trace Gas Orbiter’s primary mission is to conduct a precise inventory of the planet’s atmosphere, in particular the trace gases which make up less than 1 percent of the planet’s total volume of atmosphere. Of particular interest is methane, which on Earth is produced largely by biological activity, and also by natural and geological processes. Hints of methane have previously been reported by Mars Express, and later by NASA’s Curiosity rover on the surface of the planet, but the Trace Gas Orbiter’s highly sensitive instruments have so far reported a general absence of the gas, deepening the mystery. In order to corroborate the different results, scientists are not only investigating how methane might be created, but also how it might be destroyed close to the surface. Not all lifeforms generate methane, however, and the rover with its underground drill will hopefully be able to tell us more. Certainly the continued exploration of the red planet will help us understand how and why Mars’ habitability potential has changed over time.

Despite starting with the same ingredients, Earth’s neighbors suffered devastating climate catastrophes and could not hold on to their water for long. Venus became too hot and Mars too cold; only Earth became the “Goldilocks” planet with the just-right conditions. Did we come close to becoming Mars-like in a previous ice age? How close are we to the runaway greenhouse effect that plagues Venus? Understanding the evolution of these planets and the role of their atmospheres is tremendously important for understanding climatic changes on our own planet as ultimately the same laws of physics govern all. The data returned from our orbiting spacecraft provide natural reminders that climate stability is not something to be taken for granted.

In any case, in the very long term – billions of years into the future – a greenhouse Earth is an inevitable outcome at the hands of the aging sun. Our once life-giving star will eventually swell and brighten, injecting enough heat into Earth’s delicate system to boil our oceans, sending it down the same pathway as its evil twin.

The event, which measured 5 on the Volcanic Explosively Index, has been declared the most disastrous in modern US history. A huge column of volcanic material rose 80,000ft into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 states, killing at least 57 people and causing more than £770million in damage.

The volcano, which is an active stratovolcano, had not posed a threat since its last period of activity in the Forties and Fifties. However, it was revealed during Amazon Prime’s “The Fire Below Us” documentary how a series of small earthquakes indicated that magma had begun moving below once again. The 1995 series revealed: “The siren song of Mount St Helens began on March 20.

“For the next 29 days, the mountain continued to shake with hundreds of tremors. “The frequency peaked on March 25 with 22 significant earthquakes in one eight-hour period. “In response to the increasing threat, the forest service began evacuating personnel and established the first closure zones and warned residents of the dangers of earthquake-induced avalanches.""

 The documentary went on to reveal how the earthquakes became increasingly frequent and opened a second crater. It added: “Then on March 27, an eruption of steam and ash opened a new crater on the mountaintop and Washington’s backyard volcano made its news debut.

“A few days later, a second, larger crater formed next to the first. “Then the dreadful discovery – the north side of St Helens had been deforming creating a 200-foot high bulge that was growing at the incredible rate of five feet a day.” It was not until two months later, on May 18, that any significant activity occurred. At 8:32am, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centred directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide approximately seven seconds after the shock. The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at 110 to 155 mph and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm.",Mount St Helens: How volcano ‘shook itself AWAKE’ after earthquake
414,SCIENCE,"The bulk of Earth's coral reefs are in a very sorry state. In fact, if current climate trends continue, there's a very real risk that your grandkids will grow up in a world without any coral reefs at all. But in the waters off the coast of Hawaii, scientists have recently discovered a collection of corals that aren't going down without a fight.

A new study has documented the discovery of ""super corals"" that appear to have adapted to the harsh inhospitable waters in Hawaii's Kāne'ohe Bay. While the battle is far from won, the marine biologists who discovered the reef say it ""offers hope for reef resilience and effective conservation over coming decades.""

Reporting in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, marine biologists at the University of Hawai'i have noted that the coral reefs of Kāne'ohe Bay were devastated by human activity from the 1930s to 1970s. Along with being pummeled by sewage and pollution, the waters were also subjected to warming temperatures and ocean acidification. This culminated in up to 95 percent of the reefs suffering from catastrophic bleaching and damage. Then, in the late 1970s, the situation started to ease up when sewage outfalls were recollected away from the reef. Within just 20 years, parts of the reef had recovered by 50 to 90 percent.

Typically, as we've regularly seen elsewhere in the world, this level of stress is enough to spark widespread bleaching events so severe the coral reefs can't recover. However, in Kāne'ohe Bay, numerous species of coral appear to have gained a tolerance to the acidic warmer waters and are bouncing back strongly.

To dive deeper in this phenomenon, they took colonies of coral from Kāne'ohe Bay and another reef in Waimānalo Bay, around 18 kilometers (11 miles) away, and compared how they fared against harsh waters under lab conditions. After living in a tank for 2.5 months with unfavorable water conditions, the Kāne'ohe Bay corals were notably more resilient and grew more than twice as fast as the Waimānalo Bay corals.

It appears that this isn't just a short-term adaptation either. ""The question now becomes, what mechanisms allow corals in these locations to show increased temperature and pH tolerance? Although our experiments in Kāne'ohe Bay seem to rule out short-term acclimatization, the mechanism remains unknown,"" the authors wrote in the study.

It is too soon to say how common ""super corals"" are elsewhere in the world, nor whether they could recolonize devastated reefs in other parts of the planet. Nevertheless, the research shows that there is still hope for the world's struggling reefs.

""If we take the necessary steps now then we will begin to see this re-establishment by corals during our lifetime, and our children and grandchildren will be able to witness the recovery of coral reefs during theirs because we make the decision that reefs are worth saving,"" study author Christopher P. Jury, Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, told AFP News Agency.","Scientists discovered 'super coral' that has been thriving in warm and acidic water in Hawaii, and it could be the key to saving the dying reefs"
415,SCIENCE,"Unusual and abundant glassy spheres found packed within the beach sands near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are remnants of the 1945 atomic bomb explosion, according to new research.

On 6 August 1945, a US B-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima. In an instant, some 80,000 people were killed. The explosion and ensuing firestorms razed an area measuring more than 4 square miles (10 square kilometres), damaging upwards of 90 per cent of all the structures in the city.

But what goes up must eventually come down. New research published this week in the science journal Anthropocene is “the first published record and description of fallout resulting from the destruction of an urban environment by atomic bombing,” according to the authors of the new paper. The works shows that the nearby beaches on the Motoujina Peninsula in Hiroshima Bay are surprisingly littered with this fallout debris up to a depth of around 4 inches (10 centimetres).

Described as “millimetre-sized, aerodynamically-shaped debris,” these particles included glass spheroids, glass filaments, and melted composite compounds. The debris is reminiscent of the spherical particles found in the ground layer associated with the meteor impact that triggered a mass extinction 66 million years ago, and also the particles found in the area where the U.S. first tested the atomic bomb, according to the paper’s lead author, geologist Mario Wannier. Unlike these particles, however, the ones found near Hiroshima were packed with materials such as iron, steel, and rubber.

“In the surprise of finding these particles, the big question for me was: You have a city, and a minute later you have no city. There was the question of: ‘Where is the city—where is the material?’ It is a trove to have discovered these particles. It is an incredible story,” Wannier said in a Berkeley Lab statement.

Back in 2015, Wannier was sifting through particles of sand he had pulled from a beach just outside the city of Hiroshima. He was looking for marine life, but the weird glassy spheres in the mixture reminded him of the particles found in sediment samples from the 66-million-year-old Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) time period. The glassy spheres were between 0.5 millimetres to 1 millimetre in diameter. Some were fused together, and others were shaped like a teardrop. But unlike the spheroids pulled from the K-Pg sediment, these particles contained a surprising diversity of materials coated in multiple layers of silica. Intrigued, Wannier returned to the area to collect more beach samples.

In each kilogram of sand taken from Motoujina Peninsula beach, Wannier and his University of California, Berkeley colleagues found that spheroids and other unusual glass particles made up 0.6 to 2.5 per cent of the total sample. Extrapolating from this, that means each square kilometre of beach down to a depth of around 10 centimetres contains 2,300 to 3,100 tonnes of these particles. That is, the stuff that once made up the city of Hiroshima.

Using both conventional and scanning electron microscopes, and with the help of UC Berkeley mineralogist Rudy Wenk, the researchers detected six distinct morphological types of particles, ranging from clear glass to rubber-like substances. The team found evidence of aluminium, silicon, calcium, carbon, and oxygen, and also traces of building materials, such as pure iron and steel. The composition of this debris is consistent with materials that were common in Hiroshima at the time, including concrete, marble, stainless steel, and rubber.

These particles formed in extreme conditions, in which temperatures reached 3,330 degrees Fahrenheit (1,830 degrees Celsius), according to the research. The tremendous explosion turned ground materials into liquid, blasting the melted material into the sky. Once at a high elevation, the various particles smashed into each other, resulting in the complex agglomerations observed by the researchers.

The authors of the new study admitted that some of this debris could have been caused by other processes, such as a fire at a nearby Mazda plant in 2004 and a local site where fireworks are displayed annually. That said, “no alternative scenario to the A-bomb explosion can provide a coherent explanation for all our observations,” the authors noted in the new study, concluding that:

As noted, similar spheroids were found at the Trinity test site in New Mexico. But these glasses, dubbed trinitite, lacked the chemical compounds found in the samples taken near Hiroshima. Accordingly, the authors of the new study have dubbed the new material “Hiroshimaites” on account of its distinctive and diverse chemical composition.

Looking ahead, the researchers would like to explore the soils near Nagasaki to determine if similar particles exist there.",Beach Sands Near Hiroshima Are Still Packed With 1945 Nuclear Fallout Debris
416,SCIENCE,"The ESA has given a glimpse of the Lowell Crater in never before seen detail. The huge dent in the side of the planet stretches more than 200 kilometres across, and is believe to be around 3.9 billion years old. The crater has been named after US mathematician, astronomer and writer Percival Lowell, who founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894.

ESA established the stunning image through seven different Mars Express satellite flybys of the crater, which were merged into one spectacular photo.

Surrounding the Lowell Crater are huge mountains, which were created when a large asteroid pummelled into the region of Mars known as Aonia Terra, within the planet’s ancient southern highlands.

The ESA said: “This so-called ‘peak ring’ is thought to have formed along with the crater. The immense energy of a large impact event causes material to surge upwards before collapsing down again, forming the kind of complex morphology seen here, with an irregular mountain range encircling the crater’s centre, inside the main crater rim.”

Scientists at the ESA have compared it to the Chicxulub crater – the impact site in Mexico from when an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.",Mars photos: Stunning new high definition pictures of Red Planet released
417,SCIENCE,"I interesting than another quarterly business update. On May 9th Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, had his coming-out party as a space cadet. Mr Bezos, who is the world’s richest man, has long been interested in using his fortune to advance the cause of space flight. His private rocketry firm, Blue Origin, was founded in 2000. But he has been less of a publicity seeker than Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and the world’s best-known enthusiast for outer space.

No longer. During an hour-long presentation, Mr Bezos introduced Blue Origin’s prototype lunar lander, a machine that could be ready, he said, to meet America’s ambitions to return to the Moon by 2024. More striking were his plans for the farther future. Mr Musk wants humans to colonise Mars as an insurance policy should anything happen to Earth. Mr Bezos has no interest in Mars, or indeed any other planet in the solar system, all of which (except Earth) are pretty inhospitable places. Instead, he thinks humans should build their new space-going homes from scratch.

The idea is not new. Mr Bezos studied at Princeton, and one of his professors was Gerard O’Neill, a physicist. In 1976 O’Neill published “The High Frontier”, a bestselling book in which he sketched out the basic engineering principles of how such space habitats might work. It was exactly those sorts of habitat that Mr Bezos advocated as the way humans would live in the future.

O’Neill’s book offered three shapes: a cylinder, a pair of cylinders or a torus. All are hollow, with the living surface built on the inside. All rotate, with the centrifugal force felt at the walls standing in for gravity. Sunlight provides both energy—through solar panels—and illumination, thanks to a system of mirrors and windows. And all are on a heroic scale. The biggest are tens of kilometres long and have enough living room for millions of people.

For that reason, they would have to be built by a species that had already mastered space travel, using resources harvested from the asteroid belt (like Mr Musk, Mr Bezos hopes to drive down the cost of space flight as a first step). They would be strange places to live. The land would curve visibly up the sides of the structure. The superstructure of the habitat would arch across the “sky”. And rotation is not a perfect substitute for gravity, so moving objects would behave oddly, particularly if the habitat were small. But, said Mr Bezos, they also offer several advantages. Climates could be engineered (“Maui on its best day, all year long”). The best bits of Earth could be replicated elsewhere (one of his illustrations, shown below, depicted a space-going version of Florence).

Their biggest advantage, though, is the sheer amount of living space they would create. Mr Bezos’s ultimate justification for pursuing such megaprojects is his worry about the mismatch between the exponential process of population growth and the finiteness of Earth’s resources. He gave the example of energy demand, which, he says, has historically grown by around 3% a year. He argues that if this were to continue, Earth would, in a couple of centuries, need to be covered completely by solar panels. With the resources of the solar system at its command, however, and thousands of habitats scattered through space, the human population could comfortably grow to a trillion or more.

Perhaps. It is notable that Mr Bezos’s justifications come from the same era as his proposed solutions. It is a mathematical truism that exponential growth will eventually overwhelm any fixed, finite quantity. Such arguments were most famously applied to natural resources in “The Limits to Growth”, published by the Club of Rome in 1972. Not so much a bold new future, then, but a blast from the past.",Jeff Bezos’s ambition to colonise space is straight from the 1970s
418,SCIENCE,"An enormous volcanic eruption on Iceland in 1783-84 didn’t cause an extreme summer heat wave in Europe, but it did trigger an unusually cold winter, according to a new study.

Researchers say the findings, which appear in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, will help improve predictions of how the climate will respond to future high-latitude volcanic eruptions.

The eight-month eruption of the Laki volcano, beginning in June 1783, was the largest high-latitude eruption in the last 1,000 years. It injected about six times as much sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere as the 1883 Krakatau or 1991 Pinatubo eruptions, says coauthor Alan Robock, professor in the environmental sciences department at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.

The eruption coincided with unusual weather across Europe. The summer was unusually warm with July temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the norm, leading to societal disruption and failed harvests. The 1783–84 European winter was up to 5 degrees colder than average.

Benjamin Franklin, the US ambassador to France, speculated on the causes in a 1784 paper, the first publication in English on the potential impacts of a volcanic eruption on the climate.

To determine whether Franklin and other researchers were right, researchers performed 80 simulations with a state-of-the-art climate model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The computer model included weather during the eruption and compared the ensuing climate with and without the effects of the eruption.

“It turned out, to our surprise, that the warm summer was not caused by the eruption,” Robock says. “Instead, it was just natural variability in the climate system. It would have been even warmer without the eruption. The cold winter would be expected after such an eruption.”

More than 60 percent of Iceland’s livestock died within a year, and about 20 percent of the people died in a famine. Reports of increased death rates and/or respiratory disorders crisscrossed Europe.

“Understanding the causes of these climate anomalies is important not only for historical purposes, but also for understanding and predicting possible climate responses to future high-latitude volcanic eruptions,” Robock says.

“Our work tells us that even with a large eruption like Laki, it will be impossible to predict very local climate impacts because of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.”

Scientists continue to work on the potential impacts of volcanic eruptions on people through the Volcanic Impacts on Climate and Society project and will include the Laki eruption in their research. Volcanic eruptions can have global climate impacts lasting several years.

420,HEALTH,"There are plenty of studies in mice linking processed foods to problems such as obesity and intestinal inflammation.

But mice are not people, as critics of such studies are quick to point out.

In humans, researchers have reported associations between processed foods and health outcomes, such as an increased risk of developing obesity, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and even death.

Yet, ultra-processed foods make up a staggering 57.9% of energy intake in the United States.

According to the NOVA food classification system, ultra-processed foods include soft drinks, packaged snacks, meat nuggets, frozen meals, and foods high in additives and low in unprocessed ingredients.

""Previous studies have found correlations between ultra-processed food consumption and obesity,"" Kevin D. Hall, from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, MD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), explained to Medical News Today.

Hall and his colleagues now present the results of a controlled clinical trial, comparing the effects of unprocessed versus ultra-processed foods on humans in the journal Cell Metabolism.

The research team recruited 10 male and 10 female volunteers who stayed at the NIH Clinical Center for 28 days.

Half of the participants ate ultra-processed food for the first 2 weeks while the others received unprocessed foods. After the 2-week period, the groups switched, allowing each participant to eat both the ultra-processed food and the unprocessed food for 2 weeks.

The volunteers ate three meals per day, and the researchers asked them to eat as much or as little as they wanted. They also had access to snacks and bottled water all day.

""We hypothesized that ultra-processed foods might lead to increased calorie intake because they are often high in sugar, fat, and salt while being low in fiber,"" Hall told MNT. ""Therefore, when we matched the ultra-processed and unprocessed diets for these nutrients, we expected the ultra-processed diet to result in similar calorie intake and little differences in body weight.""

When the volunteers were on the ultra-processed diet, however, they ate an average of 508 calories more each day than when they were on the unprocessed diet. As a result, they put on an average of 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms) during this time, mostly in the form of body fat.

Participants in the unprocessed food group lost an average of 0.9 kg during the 2 week study period. This group also saw increases in the gut hormone peptide YY, which suppresses hunger, and decreases in the hunger hormone ghrelin.

Speed might be the problem

There are several reasons that Hall and his colleagues think may have led the volunteers in the ultra-processed study group to put on weight.

Although the study participants rated the pleasantness and familiarity of the diets as equal, they ate significantly faster in the ultra-processed group.

In fact, they consumed an extra 17 calories, or 7.4 grams of food per minute, than their counterparts in the unprocessed food group.

""There may be something about the textural or sensory properties of the food that made them eat more quickly,"" Hall comments. ""If you're eating very quickly, perhaps you're not giving your gastrointestinal tract enough time to signal to your brain that you're full. When this happens, you might easily overeat.""

Despite a close match in the macronutrient composition of both diets, the unprocessed diet contained slightly more protein. ""It could be that people ate more because they were trying to reach certain protein targets,"" Hall comments.

Yet the team found that the ultra-processed food group actually consumed more carbohydrates and fat than the unprocessed food group, but not protein.

Finally, the meals in the ultra-processed group had a higher energy density than in the unprocessed group, which Hall proposes ""likely contributed to the observed excess energy intake.""

The authors identify several limitations in their study, which include that ""the inpatient environment of the metabolic ward makes it difficult to generalize our results to free-living conditions.""

They also acknowledge that they did not take into consideration how cost, convenience, and skill influence consumers to choose ultra-processed over unprocessed foods.

""Ultra-processed foods contribute to more than half the calories consumed in the USA, and they are cheap and convenient options,"" Hall commented to MNT.

""So, I think it may be difficult to substantially reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods,"" he continued, ""especially for people in lower socioeconomic brackets who may not have the time, skill, equipment, or resources to purchase and safely store unprocessed food ingredients and then plan and safely prepare tasty, unprocessed meals.""

In the paper, Hall concludes, ""However, policies that discourage consumption of ultra-processed foods should be sensitive to the time, skill, expense, and effort required to prepare meals from minimally processed foods — resources that are often in short supply for those who are not members of the upper socioeconomic classes.""

He is not the first to suggest a connection between socioeconomics and food choices.

A recent, large-scale study in the journal Nature, suggests that in high-income countries, such as the U.S., rural populations are putting on weight faster than their city counterparts.

The authors in that study comment that this may, in part, be due to ""economic and social disadvantage, including lower education and income, lower availability, and higher price of health[ful] and fresh foods.""","Processed foods lead to weight gain, but it's about more than calories"

423,HEALTH,"Indeed, the anthrax bacteria is ""one of the biological agents most likely to be used"" in terrorism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because microscopic anthrax spores can be produced in a lab and be put into powders, sprays, food and water.

But that's only part of the anthrax profile. The bacteria occur naturally in soil all over the world. Livestock and wildlife — such as cattle, pigs, goats and deer — can pick up the bacteria as they breathe and graze in grasslands. The bacteria can be transmitted to humans as well — absorbed through a cut in the skin, for example, when slaughtering animals, or from eating infected meat that wasn't cooked at high-enough temperatures.

And there's a lot we don't know about the risks posed by anthrax in nature — notably, how many animal and human cases there are each year.

The World Health Organization says the number of human cases dropped from as many as 100,000 a year down to 2,000 in the 1980s. The number of infected animals per year is not available, but anthrax bacteria are found in the soil of every inhabited continent as well as several islands, including Haiti and parts of the Philippines and Indonesia.

Public health researchers believe cases are chronically underreported both in people and animals — partly because symptoms can mimic the flu and also because herders and hunters fear that news of anthrax in people or animals would take a toll on their livelihood.

To fill in the gaps, a team of researchers have examined 15 years of data to identify hot spots. Colin Carlson, a researcher at Georgetown University, and Ian Kracalik, a former researcher at the University of Florida and now an epidemic intelligence officer at the CDC, led this study, and Jason Blackburn, an associate professor at the University of Florida, led the data collection.

Based on their estimations, 1.1 billion livestock live in areas where the bacterial disease is found. The human involvement is also significant: 1.83 billion people reside in those areas — and approximately 63 million livestock keepers are at high risk.

To determine where anthrax is likeliest to occur around the world, the researchers looked at soil characteristics and climate data. The bacteria thrive in arid and semi-arid climates with slightly alkaline soil but are also present in temperate highlands like in China.

Then the researchers looked at the population of livestock and wild animals in those areas — and the population of humans.

They found that the countries with the greatest number of people at risk are Bangladesh, China, India and South Africa.

Other regions, such as North America, see cases as well. But animals there are routinely vaccinated, and food safety measures keep anthrax-infected meat from being eaten.

Wendy Turner, an assistant professor of biological sciences at University of Albany who was not affiliated with this study, calls the map ""a good first start.""

""It's kind of surprising that this work has only been done now, to be quite honest,"" she tells NPR.

An animal that has not been vaccinated will quickly die from an anthrax infection unless antibiotics are administered.

But the vaccine isn't always an easy solution. It must be administered annually. And access to the vaccine may be limited in the poorest parts of the world, Carlson says. Yet those are often the regions where animals — and the people who interact with them — need it the most.

Parts of sub-Saharan Africa as well as south and east Asia have extremely low vaccinations rates — from less than 1 percent to 6 percent, according to this study. These are the regions where more than half of the livestock and 48.5 million livestock keepers are at risk.

People can experience a variety of symptoms if infected. In cases where the bacteria gets under people's skin, symptoms include fever, fatigue and black sores on the skin. About 20 percent of people who get cutaneous anthrax, as this type is called, die if they aren't treated with antibiotics, but nearly everyone survives with treatment.

Those who eat tainted and undercooked meat may also experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal anthrax has higher fatality rates: more than half of people die with no treatment and 40 percent die even after taking antibiotics.

The deadliest of all is inhalation anthrax. That's the kind that terrorists seek to spread. But it also occurs in nature — if someone working in a slaughterhouse or wool mill inhales spores, for example. With no treatment, 85 to 90 percent of people die, and 45 percent die even with treatment.

There is a vaccine for people, but it is usually only given to first responders to potential terror attacks and to laboratory technicians who work with the bacteria closely.

In affected countries, anthrax infection causes ""significant"" economic and public health problems, especially in poor, rural communities, says Antonio Vieira, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology who was not part of this research.

""Mapping hot spots or areas more susceptible to anthrax outbreaks is extremely important and helpful for preparedness and targeting interventions,"" he writes in an email.

The report, the researchers say, is intended as a starting point. From here, public health workers and policymakers can begin focusing on anthrax hot spots and fine-tuning their responses — from administering more livestock vaccinations to training health workers to recognize symptoms in people.

""This is the first global picture we have of this,"" Carlson says. ""It's a little bit like the black hole photo. Now that we can look at this thing — what next?""",The Unanswered Questions About Anthrax
424,HEALTH,"DETROIT - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed an additional measles case in St. Clair County, bringing the state total to 44 for 2019.

This new case in St. Clair County involves an international traveler visiting Michigan, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. It is not related to the Southeast Michigan outbreak, according to the health department.

Although this measles case is in St. Clair County, there are exposure locations in Macomb County.
• May 12, 9 a.m. – 1 p.m., Saints Cyril and Methodius Roman Catholic Parish, 41233 Ryan Road, Sterling Heights.

The health department says individuals who were at those locations during those time periods should monitor themselves for signs of measles 21 days after exposure and consult their healthcare provider if they have not been vaccinated or are unsure of their vaccination status.

The health department urges all Michigan residents to contact their healthcare provider or local health department about getting vaccinated for measles if they have not been vaccinated. A complete listing of local health departments is available at Malph.org/resources/directory.

Regular walk-in hours for vaccination at the St. Clair County Health Department, 3415 28th Street, Port Huron are Mondays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and by appointment Tuesday through Friday 8 a.m. – 4 p.m.

 Macomb County Health Department is hosting vaccination clinics at the following locations:

Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease that is spread by direct person-to-person contact, and through the air. The virus can live for up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:
• High fever (may spike to over 104˚F).
• Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin.
• A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms, and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin.

426,HEALTH,"NIH-funded study followed teens, adults with long-term obesity five years after gastric bypass.

Despite similar weight loss, teens who had gastric bypass surgery were significantly more likely to have remission of both type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, compared to adults who had the same procedure. Results are from an NIH-funded study comparing outcomes in the two groups five years after surgery. Previously, no treatment has shown longer-term effectiveness at reversing type 2 diabetes in youth, which tends to advance more quickly than in adults.

Researchers evaluated 161 teens and 396 adults who underwent this surgery at clinical centers participating in Teen-LABS (Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery) and its adult counterpart, LABS. Teens in the study were under 19 years old at the time of surgery, and adults in the study reported having obesity by age 18. Teen-LABS clinical centers had specialized experience in the surgical evaluation and management of young people with severe obesity, and both studies were funded primarily by NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

“Obesity increases the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and these conditions can be more difficult to manage in young people,” said Mary Evans, Ph.D., a study author and program director in the NIDDK Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition. “We found earlier bariatric surgery in carefully selected youth may have greater benefits compared to waiting until later in life.”
• Overall weight loss percentage was not different between the groups. Teens lost 26% of their bodyweight and adults lost 29% at five years after surgery.
• Type 2 diabetes declined in both groups, but teens with type 2 diabetes before surgery were 27% more likely than adults to have controlled blood glucose (blood sugar) without the use of diabetes medications.
• No teens in the group needed diabetes medications after surgery, compared to 88% of teens before surgery. 79% of adults used diabetes medications before surgery, and 26% used diabetes medications five years later.
• Before surgery, 57% of teens and 68% of adults used blood pressure medications. Five years after surgery, 11% of teens and 33% of adults used blood pressure medications.
• Among those with high blood pressure before surgery, teens were 51% more likely than adults to no longer have high blood pressure or take blood pressure medication.

However, teens were more likely to have increased risks in other areas, including a need for subsequent abdominal surgeries, most commonly gall bladder removal. Teens were also more likely to have low iron and vitamin D levels, potentially because teens may be less likely to take enough vitamin and mineral supplements after surgery. There was a similar death rate for both teens and adults five years after surgery, including two people from the teen group who died from overdose. There is an overall increasing trend of drug overdose deaths in the U.S., and a previous LABS study found an increased risk of substance and alcohol use disorders after bariatric surgery in adults.

“Although there are risks associated with bariatric surgery, this study demonstrates that, for many young people, the benefits likely outweigh the risks,” said Thomas Inge, M.D., Ph.D., the study’s first author from Children’s Hospital Colorado. “Sufficient vitamin and mineral supplementation, along with continued medical care, can help mitigate some of these risks.”

These results build on earlier research related to the benefits, risks, and timing of bariatric surgery to aid in weight management. Obesity affects more than one in three adults and about 17% of American children and teens. Obesity increases risk for type 2 diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, some types of cancer, and other health conditions.

“Type 2 diabetes in youth has been a growing problem without a solution, hitting young adults with serious health conditions when they should be in the prime of their lives. This study demonstrates that bariatric surgery may provide an effective treatment, though not one without risks,” said NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers. “We hope future research continues to shed light on the best timing and the most effective treatments for all people with weight-related conditions.”

NIH launched LABS and Teen-LABS in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to assess the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery among adults and teens with severe obesity. Teen-LABS (NCT00474318) is supported by NIDDK under grants UM1DK072493 and UM1DK095710. LABS (NCT00465829) was supported by NIDDK under U01DK066557, U01DK66667, U01DK66568, U01DK66471, U01DK66526, U01DK66585 and U01DK66555.

427,HEALTH,"Eating a low-fat, plant-based diet could help significantly lower a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer, and the key appears to be changing eating habits before tumors have a chance to develop, according to a study released Wednesday.

The new findings are from a long-term analysis of the federally funded Women's Health Initiative, and included data on more than 48,000 postmenopausal women across the U.S.When the WHI study began in 1993, the women were in their 50s, 60s and 70s, and had never been diagnosed with breast cancer.

Nearly 20,000 of those women spent the next eight years carefully logging what they ate, aiming for less dietary fat, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

The women were tracked for 20 years, through 2013. Researchers from the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who analyzed the data found that women who stuck to the low-fat, plant-based diet had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer.

""This is the first randomized trial where breast cancer was an endpoint, and we've been able to show a reduction in deaths,"" said study author Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.

Breast cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women, according to the American Cancer Society.

The new study did not find a significant drop in breast cancer cases overall, although it's unclear why. It's too soon to say that a low-fat, plant-based diet does not protect a women from developing breast cancer, experts note.

""It could be that we need more follow-up, or that the effect on cases would have been stronger if the diet was continued for a longer period of time,"" said Dr. Neil Iyengar, who studies the relationship between diet and cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He was not involved in the new research.

One thing is certain, Iyengar said. ""Diet is a powerful tool in changing the way cancer behaves or responds to treatment.""

Other cancer experts agree. ""That healthy start is going to make a difference going through treatment,"" said Dr. Chasse Bailey-Dorton, chief of integrative oncology at the Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""We don't know why so many of us get breast cancer,"" Bailey-Dorton said. ""There are multiple factors. But the more factors you can take out, you're going to have a different outcome.""

The findings are scheduled to be presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June.

Researchers took a close look at the women's metabolic risk factors, such as abdominal fat, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar. The more metabolic risk factors a women has, the higher her risk for developing cancer.

""Most people are aware that obesity increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease, but many are not aware of the cancer risk,"" Iyengar told NBC News. Obesity is a major risk factor for at least 13 different cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.

This study found the greater a woman's metabolic risk, the greater the benefit of the dietary intervention. When the research team looked at women with three or four metabolic risk factors, the risk of dying from breast cancer plummeted by 69 percent.

Women in the study were told to consume no more than 20 percent of daily calories from fat. Not many were able to achieve that, but it didn't matter. Benefits were significant even if women were only able to reduce fat intake to 24.5 percent of their daily calories.

""If we move the needle in a favorable way and don't quite achieve that target,"" Iyengar said, ""there does appear to be a benefit.""

And the study participants accomplished this by staying in their food comfort zone. ""You can do it largely with substitutions, not changing what you're eating, but changing the preparation, and choosing smaller portions,"" Chlebowski said.

That means eating a 4-ounce steak, rather than an 8-ounce serving, for example. That cuts some of the dietary fat, but also leaves room on the plate for added veggies or grains.

Others say the findings reinforce what they've long advised, though the focus on fat has changed over the years.

In the early 1990s when the study began, the concern was overall fat in the diet, according to cancer prevention expert Karen Basen-Engquist of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

""Now we focus on saturated fat,"" Basen-Engquist said. ""It's possible that if they designed this study today, they'd probably have a much bigger emphasis on saturated fat that comes from meats and dairy products.""

428,HEALTH,"Why An Indonesian Rehab Center Doesn't Insist On Abstinence

Sam Nugraha runs a rehab center in Indonesia, and to understand his approach to addiction, he says it's important to know something about his country.

Sometimes, Nugraha says, Indonesians smile when they aren't really smiling. They're smiling, but underneath the smile, they aren't.

""Because the culture tells us we have to be polite,"" he says, ""when we don't know the answer, then we have to smile. When we feel threatened, we have to smile. In our culture we are not supposed to expose our shortcomings to other people.""

There's an Indonesian word that captures this — malu. There are a lot of ways to translate malu, but one way is to define malu as a mask. Everyone knows what's underneath, but you still keep the mask on, hiding the stuff that doesn't look good.

In the 1990s, a lot of heroin came into Indonesia from other parts of Southeast Asia. Nugraha became addicted in college. He spent time in mental hospitals and in jail. Finally he landed at a rehab program based on the famous addiction treatment program Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA. The program also offered meetings of NA, Narcotics Anonymous.

AA wasn't common in Indonesia, and it was all new to Nugraha. Especially the AA approach of sharing in meetings, where group members tell stories of addiction and their path to recovery and abstinence — AA is an abstinence-based program. Nugraha still remembers his first NA meeting.

""They always introduce themselves by telling, 'Hi, my name is X, and I'm an addict.' And the group immediately respond, 'Hi X!' "" Nugraha laughs. He remembers thinking, ""What's going on?""

Malu culture had taught Nugraha to conceal his feelings. Now he was talking to a group about deeply personal things, like his relationship with his father. ""I was scared to be honest. It's twisting everything you believe.""

""It's very American — people saying out loud their feelings to strangers and all that.""

Even though this approach was foreign, Nugraha ultimately embraced it — in three years he made it through the 12 steps. Then he did a six-month training program and became a peer counselor. Nugraha embraced the talking-about-your-feelings approach and AA's emphasis on abstinence.

John Kelly, a professor of psychiatry and addiction medicine at Harvard Medical School, has done a lot of research on Alcoholics Anonymous. ""As an entity broadly speaking, [AA]'s most well suited for abstinence,"" Kelly says. The 12 steps, he says, are designed for people who want to quit — who want to completely stop drinking or using drugs.

And in AA, sobriety often comes with congratulations. You can receive plastic tokens as milestones for your weeks, months or years of sobriety — in some meetings you can even receive birthday cake celebrations for your ""sobriety birthday"" to mark another year of abstinence.

As a counselor, Nugraha subscribed to this idea of abstinence only until something happened with a client he really liked. The client ultimately stayed sober and graduated from the program. Less than six months later, Nugraha learned that his former client had overdosed and died.

""And that actually got me thinking, 'What was wrong?' I mean, what can prevent him from dying?""

Nugraha started to wonder, what if AA and its focus on sobriety weren't right for everyone?

In 2010 he decided to start his own addiction treatment program called Rumah Singgah PEKA — Indonesian for Stop-by House. The official motto is ""When the whole world rejects you, stop by at Rumah Singgah.""

The center is in Bogor, a city about an hour south of the capital, Jakarta, with views of the nearby mountains. It's located in a big peach-colored house with a tile walkway to the door that's lined with several small dogs. Nugraha says the dogs are ""addicts too"" — apparently they're addicted to humans.

The rehab center has a staff of around 20, including three addiction and mental health specialists. There's also a doctor on call who specializes in working with people who use drugs. Rumah Singgah is currently funded entirely by the Indonesian government.

The place has many of the things you'll find at a lot of rehab centers, like cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of talk therapy with a counselor, and job-training programs.

But there's something that's a departure from the abstinence-based AA model. Rumah Singgah clients are not required to be completely sober.

The patients can't use on the premises, but Nugraha will not kick out patients who do drugs or drink alcohol while still in the program, as long as they tell their counselors. It's the first rehab program of its kind in Indonesia, but it's part of a movement around the world that's sometimes called ""harm reduction.""

""Harm reduction is an agreement that you start with the person where they're at,"" says Daniel Ciccarone. He's a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California San Francisco and the lead investigator on the Heroin in Transition project funded by the National Institutes of Health. He has been working in harm reduction for two decades. ""The underlying philosophy is that we don't immediately think, a priori, you're going to change your person,"" he says. In other words, you're starting with the person as they are.

""It came out of ... a stance that we're not taking care of people with HIV, we're not taking care of people who use drugs,"" Ciccarone says. ""We're not taking care of a number of people in society with highly stigmatized illnesses.""

Harm reduction in addiction treatment grew during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s as clinicians promoted clean syringe exchanges, acknowledging that patients might keep using drugs but still trying to reduce the spread of HIV and hepatitis and decrease overdoses.

Today harm reduction can also refer to prenatal clinics designed for pregnant women addicted to drugs — clinics keep that in mind in treatment. Or even, in other places, supplying the patient with small amounts of the drugs the patient is addicted to.

Ciccarone sees harm reduction as a reaction to a doctor-knows-best approach to medicine. He says that in the past, patients would listen to doctors ""as if they were your pastor. You listened to them and you obeyed them, right?""

He sees harm reduction as a more collaborative approach to addiction, with the patient and the doctor engaging in ""a negotiated contract to make [the patient] better.""

Nugraha's Rumah Singgah treatment program is based on partnerships with patients. ""We do not decide what's best for our clients,"" Nugraha says. ""The clients have to decide what's best for them.""

And that might include drinking alcohol once a week. Nugraha does not measure success based on whether people get sober but on their quality of life. Are they holding down a job? Are they healthy? How are their relationships going? The overriding question is how well the patients are achieving the goals they set for themselves with their counselors.

Harm reduction programs often provoke strong reactions. When Nugraha's clinic opened, his neighbors attacked him for his approach — especially his methadone program. Methadone is a medication that helps with the cravings associated with heroin addiction, much like a nicotine patch would for those trying to quit smoking. With patients coming into the neighborhood for methadone medicines, the neighbors told Nugraha, ""[You're] a new drug dealer in town. You're just helping people to keep using drugs.""

The way Nugraha sees it is that addiction is a disease like diabetes or any other. You can't expect everyone to get sober. And Anna Lembke, medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford University's School of Medicine, says that the medical community across the U.S. is broadening its understanding of the role of sobriety in addiction treatment.

""There's a rethinking in the field of addiction medicine whether abstinence is the only definition of recovery,"" she says. ""As we're encountering more and more behavioral addictions like addictions to food and sex — we can't expect people to abstain from food and sex — therefore we have to think about what healthy consumption looks like.""

Nugraha does recommend abstinence-based AA programs to clients who he thinks will benefit from the support group element. And Kelly notes, AA and NA accept that relapse is a part of a process, and those who relapse and come back to the program are accepted and encouraged. There's even a line in the NA booklet that reads, ""The newcomer is the most important person at any meeting.""

But Nugraha thinks that in Indonesia, the AA approach can sometimes stir up feelings of malu and fears of being shamed — especially when relapse is involved. AA is a volunteer organization made up of thousands of groups around the world. Nugraha notes that in Indonesia some groups are less accepting of members who relapse and those who lie and are found out.

""Many people feel ashamed when they slip, [when] they use again,"" he says. ""And they don't want to admit, because it gives that feeling of being a failure.""

Nugraha is trying to create an environment in his center where people don't feel ashamed for having an addiction or for relapsing. And he doesn't want to shame them for lying.

""Lying is part of the business,"" Nugraha says. ""Humans are fragile.""

Nugraha's approach is growing in Indonesia. Now he's consulting with the Indonesian government and doing trainings across the Asia-Pacific region. People around the world need help reaching the hardest cases, and as Nugraha has found, sometimes the first step is getting past shame.

429,HEALTH,"Research from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests boys are also developing earlier, by age 10, which is six months to one year sooner than previous generations.

Pediatricians haven't identified a lone cause for this shift, but Louise Greenspan, a pediatric endocrinologist at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, says childhood obesity, environmental chemical-contributors, and the effects of chronic stress — a hormonal response to neglect or abuse in the family, for example — may all play a role.

At a crucial time when kids long to fit in, puberty can make them stand out. And when breast buds and body hair sprout during elementary school, children often feel exposed. Unable to hide their sexual development from others, they may feel ashamed or embarrassed.

Cosette Taillac, a psychotherapist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., recalls a particular client, a 9-year-old girl, who was started to feel self-conscious playing soccer because her body was developing.

When the little girl no longer wanted to participate in sports — something she had always loved — her parents sought Taillac's help.

""She didn't want to dress in front of her teammates,"" says Taillac.

Studies show girls who physically mature early, may be more likely than boys to ruminate about these uneasy feelings. According to researchers, this can prolong the emotional distress, which may increase their risk of depression and anxiety.

Still, though girls are more likely to internalize the stress they feel, boys aren't unscathed, says Mendle.

In research by Mendle and her colleagues, early maturing boys were more likely than others to feel socially isolated and to face conflict with friends and classmates. ""This may increase their risk of depression,"" she says,""but we're uncertain if these effects last into adulthood.""

Because information about early development tends to focus on girls, parents are often perplexed when their sons start puberty early, says Fran Walfish, a child and adolescent psychotherapist in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Their first clue, she says, may come when a tween boy refuses to shower or wear deodorant.

Helping kids navigate these new social and emotional hurdles can be tricky, especially since puberty spans several years. But don't be afraid to reach out — or to start the conversation early.

Greenspan suggests talking to children about sexual development by the age of 6 or 7. ""Starting the conversation when kids are young, and keeping lines of communication open can make the transition less scary,"" she says.

At times, parents may also need to advocate for their children. ""My client's parents worked with the soccer coach to create more privacy for her when dressing for team events,"" says Taillac. The simple adjustment helped the girl feel safe and more confident.

Of course, not all kids are eager for a parent's help; some shy away from even talking about their newfound struggles. That's sometimes a sign they're confused or overwhelmed, child psychologists say.

""It's important for parents to realize that puberty triggers identity questions like 'Who am I?' and 'Where do I fit in?' for boys and girls,"" Walfish says.

Taillac says reading books together can help. ""Books provide a common language to discuss what's going on, which can open up conversations between parents and children,"" she says.

For elementary school girls, ""The Care and Keeping of You: The Body Book for Younger Girls,"" by Valorie Schaefer can be a helpful book. Reading ""The Tween Book: A Growing Up Guide for the Changing You,"" by Wendy Moss and Donald Moses can be informative for boys and girls, even as they reach the teen years.

Seeing your child mature early can also worry a parent. If you find yourself unsure of how to intervene, psychologists say, remember that distraught kids often want the same thing we all seek when we're upset — a generous dose of empathy.

Luckily, compassion doesn't require parents to have all the answers. Puberty calls for the same good parenting skills as any other age: being emotionally available to kids through their developmental milestones, witnessing their growing pains, and providing comfort when life throws them curveballs.

That advice is simple; the effects powerful. Scientific evidence shows this kind of parental support helps foster emotional resilience, and that bolsters kids' health and relationships for years to come.

430,HEALTH,"Sometimes, a particularly harsh winter will put a dent in Minnesota's deer tick population. Think of it as nature's way of rewarding humanity after a long, cold winter. Only deer ticks transmit Lyme disease.

This winter was pretty rough. But was it bad enough to kill off the ticks?

The short answer: probably not.

Cold temperatures only kill ticks if they're exposed to the frigid air, said Dave Neitzel, an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health.

""So far, we're having no trouble finding the adult stage of the blacklegged tick,"" he said, ""what most people know as deer ticks.""

Ticks were insulated under a thick blanket of snow this winter, so the bitter cold didn't reach them.
• Read more: It's good to be a tick in Minnesota
• It's tick season again: Here's how to avoid the disease-carrying pests

Now that the snow has melted, Neitzel and his survey crew at the Minnesota Department of Health have been conducting field surveys in historically tick-infested areas to count tick hitchhikers.

""We have a little piece of cloth that we drag behind us in the woods,"" said Neitzel, ""and we stop every 15 to 20 meters and we pull ticks off of ourselves and pull ticks off of the cloth. A very simple sampling method, but it works really well.""

Early survey results, he said, have shown increased deer tick numbers, compared to this time last year.

More deer ticks means there's a greater likelihood of more Lyme disease cases. The condition causes fever and fatigue, then joint damage — and if left untreated, heart and neurological problems.

""In the adult stage of the blacklegged tick, it's not unusual to find that about 40 percent of the adults are infected,"" said Neitzel. ""If you have two or three blacklegged ticks on you, there's probably one that's infected for sure.""

Neitzel has been studying tick-borne diseases since the 1980s. In that time, Minnesota has gone from seeing a handful of Lyme cases a year to more than a thousand annually.
• Ticks: A summer survival guide
• Watch: How a tick digs its hooks into you

The Health Department urges people who spend time in brushy or wooded areas to protect themselves from ticks by applying repellents that contain DEET, the same ingredient that wards off mosquitoes.

Even more effective are products that contain permethrin.

""It can be applied to clothing before you go out,"" said Neitzel. ""It not only kills ticks effectively, but it's a strong repellent too.""

Regular tick checks are also recommended. One tip for finding the tiny deer ticks is to step into sunlight and look for reflections off of their backs, said Neitzel.

May, June and July are typically the worst months for Lyme disease exposure. But don't relax when August rolls around. Neitzel said it's also expected to be a bad year for mosquitoes and that raises the risk of West Nile virus, especially later this summer.",Did the frigid winter take a toll on ticks? Probably not

433,HEALTH,"As more states legalize marijuana, more people in the U.S. are buying and using weed — and the kind of weed they can buy has become much stronger.

That concerns scientists who study marijuana and its effects on the body, as well as emergency room doctors who say they're starting to see more patients who come into the ER with weed-associated issues.

Some 26 million Americans ages 12 and older reported being current marijuana users in 2017, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It's not clear how many users have had serious health issues from strong weed, and there's a lot that's still unknown about the potential risks. But scientists are starting to learn more about some of them.

The potency of weed depends on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main compound responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. One study of pot products seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the potency increased from about 4% THC in 1995 to about 12% in 2014. By 2017, another study showed, the potency of illicit drug samples had gone up to 17.1% THC.

""That's an increase of more than 300% from 1995 to about 2017,"" says Staci Gruber, director of the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) program at the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. ""I would say that's a considerable increase.""

And some products with concentrated forms of cannabis, like hash and hash oil, can have as much as 80% to 90% THC, she adds.

""I think most people are aware of the phenomenon that 'this is not your grand daddy's weed,' Gruber says. ""I hear this all the time.""

But people might not be aware of the potential health risks of highly potent weed. ""The negative effects of cannabis have primarily been isolated and localized to THC,"" says Gruber. ""So it stands to reason that higher levels of THC may in fact confer a greater risk for negative outcome.""

""In general, people think, 'Oh, I don't have to worry about marijuana. It's a safe drug,' "" says Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ""The notion that it is completely safe drug is incorrect when you start to address the consequences of this very high content of 9THC.""

THC can have opposite effects on our bodies at high and low doses, Volkow says. Take anxiety levels, for example.

""When someone takes marijuana at a low [THC] content to relax and to stone out, actually, it decreases your anxiety,"" she says. But high concentrations can cause panic attacks, and if someone consumes high-enough levels of THC, ""you become full-blown psychotic and paranoid.""

Weed can have a similar paradoxical effect on the vascular system. Volkow says: ""If you take low-content THC it will increase your blood flow, but high content [THC] can produce massive vasoconstriction, it decreases the flow through the vessels.""

And at low concentrations, THC can be used to treat nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. But Volkow says that ""patients that consume high content THC chronically came to the emergency department with a syndrome where they couldn't stop vomiting and with intense abdominal pain.""

""The typical patient uses [inhales] about 10 times per day ... and they come in with really difficult to treat nausea and vomiting,"" says Andrew Monte, an associate professor of emergency medicine and medical toxicology at the University of Colorado's school of medicine. ""Some people have died from this ... syndrome, so that is concerning.""

Scientists don't know exactly how high levels of THC can trigger the syndrome, but the only known treatment is stopping cannabis use.

While the number of people who've had the syndrome is small, Monte says he and his colleagues have documented a rise in the number of cases at emergency rooms in Colorado since marijuana was legalized there five years ago. A study by Monte and his team found that cyclical vomiting cases made up about 18% of inhaled cannabis-related cases at his ER.

They also found that statewide, the overall number of ER cases associated with cannabis use has gone up. And Monte says his ER has ""seen an approximately a three-fold increase in emergency department visits just by frequency. It doesn't mean we're getting overwhelmed by these visits due to cannabis, it's just that means that there are more patients overall.""

Most people show up at his emergency department because of ""intoxication"" from too much pot, either straight or mixed with other drugs, Monte says. The bulk of these cases are due to inhaled cannabis, though edibles are associated with more psychiatric visits.

""We're seeing an increase in psychosis and hallucinations, as well as anxiety and even depression and suicidality,"" Monte says.

He thinks the increased potency of marijuana plays a role in all these cases. ""Whenever you have a higher dose of one of these types of drugs, the patient is at a higher risk of having an adverse drug event. If the concentration is so much higher ... it's much easier to overshoot the low-level high that they're looking for.""

Not everyone is at equal risk, Monte adds. ""Many many people use cannabis safely,"" he says. ""The vast majority don't end up in our emergency department.""

Some people are more vulnerable than others to the potential negative effects of high THC cannabis.

Adolescent and young adults who use recreationally are especially susceptible because their brains are still developing and are sensitive to drugs in general, says Gruber of the MIND program. In a recent review of existing studies, she found that marijuana use among adolescents affects cognition — especially memory and executive functions, which determine mental flexibility and ability to change our behavior.

Medical marijuana users can face unexpected and unwelcome effects from potent weed. ""It's very important for people to understand that they may not get the response they anticipated,"" Gruber notes.

Studies done on the medical benefits of pot usually involve very low doses of THC, says Monte, who adds that those doses ""are far lower than what people are getting in a dispensary right now.""

David Dooks, a 51-year-old based in the Boston area turned to marijuana after an ankle surgery last year. ""I thought that medical marijuana might be a good alternative to opioids for pain management,"" he says.

Based on the advice at a dispensary, David began using a variety of weed with 56.5% THC and says it only ""exacerbated the nerve pain."" After experimenting with a few other strains, he says, what worked for him was one with low (0.9%) THC, which eased his nerve pain.

Whether people are using recreationally or medically, patients should educate themselves as much as possible and be cautious while using, Monte says.

Avoiding higher THC products and using infrequently can also help reduce risk, Volkow adds. ""Anyone who has had a bad experience, whether it's psychological or biological, they should stay away from this drug,"" she notes.

Ask for as much information as possible before buying. ""You have to know what's in your weed,"" Gruber says. ""Whether or not it's conventional flower that you're smoking or vaping, an edible or tincture, it's very important to know what's in it.""

And the old saying ""start low, go slow,"" is a good rule of thumb, she adds. ""You can always add, but you can never take it away. Once it's in, it's in.""","Highly Potent Weed Has Swept The Market, Raising Concerns About Health Risks"

435,HEALTH,"Rockland County, New York, has been hit hard by the measles outbreak. That didn’t stop anti-vaccination groups holding a rally in the area Monday evening that attracted hundreds of attendees, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jews.

The “vaccine symposium” was sponsored by a Jewish group based in Monsey, New York. Attendees referenced religious beliefs and pseudoscience that they claimed disproved the effectiveness of vaccines.

Despite the growing measles outbreak — it’s reached a record high of more than 800 cases nationwide, 75 new cases this week coming from New York, since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 — attendees packed the ballroom where the event was held, according to the New York Times.

The rally’s featured speakers included Andrew Wakefield, whose widely disproved study linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism helped spur the modern anti-vaccine movement. In 2010, the UK stripped Wakefield of his medical license after he was accused for fraud and abuse.

The measles epidemic in New York, which is the worst in the country, started in ultra-Orthodox communities in October, after some unvaccinated children got sick with measles during a trip to Israel, according to the New York Times. The majority of cases in the city have been among ultra-Orthodox Jews, even though many do vaccinate their children.

As Vox’s Julia Belluz reported in October, anti-vaccination rhetoric has taken hold for reasons that have nothing to do with religious doctrine. But “the fact that some Orthodox Jews live outside the mainstream, avoid technology, and hold rabbinic opinion in high esteem may leave them particularly vulnerable to anti-vaxxers,” she wrote.

One of the most prominent ultra-Orthodox anti-vaxxers, Rabbi Hillel Handler, claimed at Monday’s rally that Jews in New York had been “demonized.” He also criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling him “a German” and “a very sneaky fellow,” for actions he said singled out Jews during the epidemic.

Despite the measles outbreaks, the rally shows the anti-vaccine movement is resilient. On Tuesday, hundreds gathered outside the New York state capital to protest against a bill that would ban religious exemptions from mandatory vaccinations. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke at the rally with a crowd of mothers cheering him on, despite criticism from his family for spreading misinformation.

Tech companies are trying to crack down on the anti-vaccination movement. If you look up vaccination-related content on Twitter, the app will display a statement from the United States Department of Health and Human Services at the top of the search results. Instagram has also blocked hashtags that spread misinformation.

It remains to be seen if this is enough to curtail a movement that has been deemed as a public health crisis. One particular challenge is fighting disinformation in tight-knit or insular communities, who might attend a rally but not see hashtags on Twitter. The group often shares the same culture and misinformation circulates within the community, which will help them justify their anti-vaccination beliefs.

Outreach from the government is often met with distrust, further isolating the community from truthful information. In order to make headway with such groups, officials must approach them in a transparent and empathetic way, University of Washington School of Medicine pediatrics professor Douglas Opel told the Wall Street Journal.

The rally Monday shows just how big that challenge is.",Anti-vaccination rallies are drawing crowds — even during the measles epidemic

437,HEALTH,"More young people under 50 are being diagnosed with bowel cancer, two studies of the disease in European and high-income countries have found.

Although total numbers of cases in young people remain low, the studies highlighted a sharp rise in rates in 20 to 29-year-olds.

Researchers are not clear why this is happening, but say obesity and poor diet could be factors.

Experts urged doctors not to ignore symptoms in young people.

In most of Europe, bowel cancer screening programmes start at the age of 50 because cases of the disease are much higher among this older age group.

As a result, countries with established programmes, like the UK, have seen bowel cancer rates in the over-50s fall.

But recent research suggests rates are now rising more steeply among under-50s - and there have been calls for screening to start at 45 instead, in the US particularly.

In a study in the journal Gut, Dutch researchers analysed trends in 20 European countries, including the UK, Germany, Sweden and France, using data from more than 143 million people.

They found a rise in cases of bowel cancer between 1990 and 2016 in most countries - with the most significant increase among people in their 20s.

For them, bowel cancer incidence increased from 0.8 to 2.3 cases per 100,000 people over 26 years - with the sharpest rise in rates, of 7.9% per year, occurring between 2004 and 2016.
• 'My bowel cancer was missed because I'm young'

But there was no increase in deaths from bowel cancer for this age group, the study found.

Among people in their 30s, rates of bowel cancer also rose - but less steeply - and among 40-somethings rates fluctuated.

The researchers, from the Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said if the trend continued, screening guidelines may need to be reconsidered.

Another study, in the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, appeared to confirm the trend among young adults in high-income countries, including the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

It found a 1.8% increase in colon cancer cases and 1.4% rise in rectal cancer cases in people under 50 in the UK between 1995 and 2014 .

Over the same period, there were decreases in bowel cancer cases of 1.2% in the over-50s.

The findings were similar in many of the countries studied.

Dr Marzieh Araghi, lead study author from International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, said the findings highlighted the need for action.

""While population-based screening in people under 50 years old is not considered to be cost-effective due to relatively low incidence numbers, family history could help to identify younger people at high risk of genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer, for further assessment,"" she said.

Dr Araghi added that more studies were needed ""to establish the root causes of this rising incidence to enable the development of effective preventive and early-detection strategies"".

Andrew Beggs, consultant colorectal surgeon from the University of Birmingham, said rising rates of bowel cancer among young patients ""must be urgently investigated"".

""This means the age at which bowel cancer screening needs to start may have to change to screen people at a younger age, and people under the age of 50 with any 'red flag' symptoms (bleeding, a change in bowel habit, weight loss or tummy pain) should get it checked out as soon as possible,"" he said.
• a persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain
• blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles
• abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating - sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss

Dr Marco Gerlinger, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said he had noticed increasing numbers of young patients with bowel cancer for some time.

""These large and high-quality studies provide solid data to support this trend,"" he said.

And he added: ""These results are a call to action to raise awareness among staff in GP practices and hospitals to consider bowel cancer as a diagnosis when young people come to them with pain, changes in bowel habits or blood in their stool.

""The new studies show a clear need to dedicate more efforts to understanding the lifestyle factors that trigger bowel cancers in young people and to rethink how screening may need to be adjusted to prevent such devastating cancers.""",Bowel cancer rise 'fastest in young people'

439,HEALTH,"Low-fat, plant-based diets may reduce the risk for women of dying from breast cancer, a new study shows.

The research showed that women who ate more fruit, vegetables and whole grains as opposed to high-fat foods, such as red meat and dairy products, were 20 percent less likely to die from breast cancer. This data suggests that diet has a strong effect either on how cancer behaves and reacts treatment.

The study, conducted by the Women’s Health Initiative, collected data from more than 48,000 postmenopausal women. The research began in 1993, and the subjects were monitored for 20 years. Out of the subjects, 3,374 developed breast cancer during the study. While there wasn’t a noticeable drop in breast cancer cases, it appears that diet affects the chances of death. Based on the study, women who limited their daily intake of fat to around 20 percent of their calories were more likely to survive.

441,HEALTH,"Drinking fruit juices is just as bad for your health- and as likely to lead to an early death - as drinking Coca-Cola, lemonade, or other fizzy drinks, research suggests.

A new study found an increased risk of dying early from any cause for people who consumed a lot of sugary drinks. US researchers compared, for the first time, 100% fruit juices with sugar-sweetened beverages such as cola and lemonade.

They found very similar associations for both fruit juices and sugary drinks with an increased risk of dying early, though they said more research was needed.

A British expert described the study as important but said there was no risk from a single 150ml glass of fruit juice per day. The new research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), analysed data from 13,440 people. Their intake of sugary drinks and 100% fruit juices was recorded via a questionnaire on how often they consumed the drinks.

During an average follow-up of six years, there were 1,000 deaths from any cause and 168 deaths from coronary heart disease. Typically, people in the study got 8.4% of their calorie intake each day from sugar-sweetened drinks and 4% from 100% fruit juice. People were considered to have a high intake of these drinks if 10% or more of energy intake came from these drinks compared with those with a low intake (less than 5%).

After factors such as obesity were taken into account, those with the highest intake had an 11% increased risk of dying from any cause for every extra 12oz of sugar-sweetened drink consumed, and a 24% increased risk for every extra 12oz of fruit juice consumed.

The researchers, including from Emory University in Atlanta and Cornell University in New York, said: ""These results suggest higher consumption of sugary beverages, including fruit juice, is associated with increased mortality.

""The nutrient content of 100% fruit juices and SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) is very similar.

""While 100% fruit juices contain some vitamins and phytonutrients that are missing from most SSBs, the predominant ingredients in both are sugar and water.

""Although the sugar in SSBs is added during processing and the sugar in 100% fruit juice occurs naturally, the specific sugars they provide for the body to process are essentially the same, and the biochemical response when metabolised is the same.""

The authors suggested a few possible reasons for the increased risk of dying from consumption of sugary drinks.

Obesity is obviously the main factor, they said, but once that is taken into account, research suggests that sugary drinks increase insulin resistance.

Other factors may be that consuming fructose alters blood lipid levels, markers of inflammation and blood pressure, while high glucose consumption has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes.

Dr Gunter Kuhnle, associate professor in nutrition and health at the University of Reading, said: ""This is a very important study, especially as fruit juices are often seen as a 'healthy' alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages, even though they often contain much more sugar (especially smoothies).

""Fruit juices can provide vitamins and even some fibre, but there is little health benefit beyond this: the amount of phytochemical found in juices is too low to have any further beneficial effect, and there is no beneficial health effect from so-called antioxidants.

""If the association is shown to be causal (which we don't know yet), this would have a number of implications: first of all, it would suggest that it does not matter whether sugary drinks are lemonades or fruit juices.

""This is important, as fruit juices and smoothies are not commonly perceived as sugary drinks. Secondly, it would suggest purported health benefits of fruit juices are not sufficient to counteract their sugar content.

""Fruit juices are a poor replacement for actual fruit consumption, in particular as they can be much more easily over-consumed.

""Indeed, a 150ml glass of orange juice is made from about two oranges - but it takes much longer to eat two oranges than to drink the juice.

""In the UK, the general recommendation is that a 150ml glass of fruit juice can provide one of the five-a-day, but not more.

""This is less than half of the amount found in this study to result in a modest increase in mortality, so there is no suggestion from this study that one glass a day is problematic.""","Fruit juice just as bad for health as Coca Cola, say experts"

Oklahoma’s first measles case since May 2018 was confirmed Wednesday in Okmulgee County. Since Jan. 1, health officials said there have been at least 839 cases of measles reported in the United States from 23 other states. This is the highest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1994. Here’s what you need to know about measles.What is measles?Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus may remain airborne up to two hours in a room after a person with measles has left an indoor area. Those who are susceptible to measles usually develop symptoms about 10 days after exposure with a range of 7-21 days.What are the symptoms?Symptoms of measles begin with a mild to moderate fever, runny nose, red eyes, and cough. A few days later, a rash appears starting on the face spreading to the rest of the body, accompanied by a fever that can reach up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Measles can lead to pneumonia and other complications, especially in young children and adults over 20. The disease can also cause serious problems in pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. A person with measles can spread the virus up to four days before the onset of the rash and until four days after the rash begins.Transmission of measlesMeasles is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe contaminated air or touch an infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected people can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears.Measles is a disease of humans; measles virus is not spread by any other animal species.PreventionMeasles can be prevented with the measles vaccine usually given in combination with rubella and mumps, called MMR vaccine, and is recommended for all children at 12 to 15 months of age and again at 4 to 6 years of age, according to Oklahoma health officials. If a person has not received a second dose of the vaccine between 4 to 6 years of age, the booster dose may be given at any age thereafter. Two doses of vaccine normally provide lifelong immunity.Why people born before 1989 may need another dose of the measles vaccineWhat year were you born? If it was before 1989, then chances are you need to get the measles vaccine again. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told KSDK that anyone born before 1989 likely received one dose because it was the norm at that time. Following 1989, though, it was discovered that two doses was the recommended amount.Those worried about their immunization levels at any age, though, should call their health care provider about possibly getting the proper dosage.

444,HEALTH,"Children are taking 10 minutes out from the hurly burly school day to reflect on their thoughts and their feelings. Some ground themselves by thinking about their feet on the floor, while others concentrate on their breathing.

This is mindfulness, the lessons quickly growing in popularity as an antidote to the stress of being a young person in the 21st century, be it pressure to perform in exams, social media, or the obsession with body image that is reported to even affect primary age children.

Children are learning about their brains and how to deal with unruly thoughts – to control emotions such as anger and fear. It is no longer head, shoulders, knees and toes, but amygdala, hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex.

The most recent NHS survey of young people’s mental health in 2017 shows one-in-eight five- to 19-year-olds in England has a diagnosable mental health condition. Hospital admissions for anorexia alone more than doubled in the eight years to 2017/18.

Stress is a known barrier to learning and a growing number of schools are targeting the emotional health of pupils through schemes such as meditation, mindfulness and the provision of mental health first aiders and buddies.

The Mental Health Foundation charity wants emotional wellbeing to be at the heart of the school curriculum, and has chosen body image as the key theme of this year’s Mental Health Awareness Week. Dr Antonis Kousoulis, its assistant director, said its survey last year found 47% of people aged 18-24 had experienced stress over their body image to the extent of being overwhelmed or unable to cope. “Social media has certainly played a part,” he says. “Historically, it was the mirror that was the main driver of perception of our image and how we thought others perceived us. Nowadays, young people are exposed almost on a 24/7 basis to manipulated and heavily edited images, whether that’s in advertising or photos of their friends.”

Over the past five years there has been a proliferation of mindfulness organisations and companies selling lesson plans and staff training to schools. But does it work?

Secondary school teacher Richard Burnett, who founded the Mindfulness in Schools Project 10 years ago, warns against “quick fix” approaches. “We are a charity started by teachers who wanted to teach children how best to manage their thoughts and feelings and deal with the rollercoaster of being a young person,” he says.

It has two training courses for teachers – one aimed at secondary students and another for younger classes. “It’s about training your attention to notice what is going on. If you are aware of that, you can choose how to respond, for example to manage the amygdala, the part of the brain that detects fear and prepares a response,” he says.

Emotional disorders are on the rise, and we should instil something in our children and young people about coping with stress, advises Lee Hudson, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health’s mental health lead. But should it be mindfulness? There is evidence that the process can bring benefits to adults, he says. “[But] the evidence for its effectiveness with children is not yet sufficiently robust and we need more research. However, some schools are rolling it out and children seem to enjoy it – and it unlikely to cause harm.”

The Department for Education is funding a major project to find the most effective ways of promoting positive mental health in schools, which is being run by the Evidence Based Practice Unit, a collaboration between the Anna Freud Centre for Children and Families and UCL’s faculty of brain science. One of the five approaches being trialled is mindfulness.

“A lot of people are interested in mindfulness and are doing it in different ways, but there is not a large evidence base for its delivery in schools,” says programme director Jaime Smith.

Meanwhile, teachers at Cherry Tree primary school in Basildon, Essex, say mindfulness lessons are already making a difference. “Children aged eight to 10 in four classes do different exercises for 10 minutes after lunch each day,” says school pastoral leader Kim Milsom. “Children have told us that mindfulness helps to calm them down and that they use it at home as well.”

Experience: ‘We need to equip them with coping strategies’

Tracey Ward, assistant head teacher at Stanley Grove primary academy, reviews her work as a trained mental health first aider

Being a mental health first aider means you have been trained to spot signs and symptoms and can “intervene early”. If you have done the Mental Health First Aid England training you are more aware of depression and anxiety.

To give a bit of context, 97% of pupils in our school have English as an additional language and 57% of the population of our area are living in poverty, according to a report last year. Wellbeing is a priority for us and we want to make sure that if our children are in a crisis in their lives, that we have equipped them with the right coping strategies – ones that are sustainable and that they will be able to use in the future.

We have converted our first aid stations into mental and physical health stations and we have trained mental health first aiders to be there at break and lunch times.

On their trays the children all have a “first aid kit” – which is a picture of an open case with a red cross on it. They write on it what they need when they are feeling distressed, overwhelmed or anxious. The children love this approach.

This week I was at one of the first aid stations when a child had an outburst and came to me saying they were “overwhelmed”. I told him to collect his mental first aid kit from the tray and we discussed what he could do. Another child came to us because they had “a busy mind” and we carried out the stress bucket activity. We discussed what was making the stress container full and what could be put in place to empty out some of the water.

We had a session with mental health first aiders in our sensory room for targeted children who need support.

Part of our approach is to embrace physical activity to support mental health. One of our wellbeing activities is the daily mile, marked out on the playground. Every child from nursery to year 6 walks, jogs or runs it every day and they can do it with a friend or a member of staff. We find children are more likely to open up about their feelings outside of the classroom. Our ethos and culture is warm and happy and I think that’s a lot to do with the importance we place on mental health and wellbeing.",Schools of thought: can mindfulness lessons boost child mental health?
445,HEALTH,"Air Pollution Is Slowly Killing Us All, New Global Study Claims

A comprehensive global study by the International Respiratory Society’s Environmental Committee and published recently in CHEST, the official publication of the American College of Chest Physicians, claims that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. Here’s the executive summary of the report.

Air pollution poses a great environmental risk to health. Outdoor fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm) exposure is the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world, accounting for 4.2 million deaths and > 103 million disability-adjusted life years lost according to the Global Burden of Disease Report. The World Health Organization attributes 3.8 million additional deaths to indoor air pollution.

Air pollution can harm acutely, usually manifested by respiratory or cardiac symptoms, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body. It can cause, complicate, or exacerbate many adverse health conditions. Tissue damage may result directly from pollutant toxicity because fine and ultrafine particles can gain access to organs, or indirectly through systemic inflammatory processes.

Susceptibility is partly under genetic and epigenetic regulation. Although air pollution affects people of all regions, ages, and social groups, it is likely to cause greater illness in those with heavy exposure and greater susceptibility. Persons are more vulnerable to air pollution if they have other illnesses or less social support. Harmful effects occur on a continuum of dosage and even at levels below air quality standards previously considered to be safe.

It wasn’t that long ago that most of us had never heard of fine particulate matter, or FPM. It’s a term that first appeared in news reports surrounding the Volkswagen diesel cheating scandal. FPM emissions from diesel engines are significant, but they are a byproduct of burning all fossil fuels.

Some, like coal, create more. Some, like natural gas, create less. But all create some fine particulates. Whether its generating electricity, powering airplanes, or fueling cars, buses, trucks, and trains, fossil fuels fill the air with crud that is bad for us to breathe.

Research is hard to do on living humans. Many of the conclusions in the report are inferential. For instance, when Beijing shut down many of the more egregious sources of air pollution in the run-up to the Olympics in 2008, median birth weights in and around the city increased.

That makes it easy for fossil fuel apologists to attack the conclusions of reports such as this. Taking lessons learned from the tobacco industry, those who suck on the teat of Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute find it ridiculously easy to suggest that unless and until a particular FPM has been conclusively linked to a particular health issue, no action can be taken that would damage the economic interests of their clients.

That’s a little like saying that unless scientists can identify the particular photon that strikes the retina of a human eye as coming from the sun, dawn is just a theory. Such distortions have worked for more than half a century now. No need to abandon such tactics now when they are working so well.

“Air pollution can harm acutely, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body,” the researchers conclude. “Ultrafine particles pass through the [lungs], are readily picked up by cells, and carried via the bloodstream to expose virtually all cells in the body.”

Prof Dean Schraufnagel, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and who led the reviews, tells The Guardian. “I wouldn’t be surprised if almost every organ was affected. If something is missing [from the review] it is probably because there was no research yet.”

The review represents “very strong science,” says Dr. Maria Neira, director of public and environmental health at the World Health Organization. “It adds to the very heavy evidence we have already. There are more than 70,000 scientific papers to demonstrate that air pollution is affecting our health. Issues like Parkinson’s or autism, for which there is some evidence but maybe not the very strong linkages, that evidence is coming now.”

The danger from FPM pollution is that those tiny particles are so small, they can cross directly into the bloodstream in the lungs. From there, they get transported to virtually every cell in the body. Unborn children are especially at risk as they are completely dependent upon the mother’s bloodstream for sustenance.

“Animal studies have shown they can even travel right up the olfactory nerve into the brain,” Schraufnagel saya. He adds that an emerging area of research suggests air pollution can affect how genes function as well. Strokes, dementia, and reduced intelligence are all conditions affecting the brain that have been linked to air pollution. Poor sleep can also be a consequence of breathing toxic air.

“Immune cells think a [pollution particle] is a bacteria, go after it and try to kill it by releasing enzymes and acids,” he explains. “Those inflammatory proteins spread into the body, affecting the brain, the kidneys, the pancreas and so forth. In evolutionary terms, the body has evolved to defend itself against infections, not pollution.”

Many doctors are unaware of the wide-ranging damage associated with air pollution, Schraufnagel says. “Some have no idea air pollution affects the organs they specialize in. But it affects their organs too and they had better pay attention. They need to educate their patients and then they should speak up in favor of action.”

The report warns that “Harmful effects occur even at levels below air quality standards previously considered to be safe. The good news is that the problem of air pollution can be addressed.” Schraufnagel says, “The best way to reduce exposure is to control it at its source.”

Addressing The Problem At Its Source

Since most air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, heat homes and power transport, “We need to work on these factors in a very dramatic way,” Dr. Neira. “We are probably the first generation in history to be exposed to such a high level of pollution.

“People will say that in London or other places it was worse 100 years ago, but now we are talking about an incredible number of people exposed for a long time. We have megacities where all the citizens are breathing toxic air. However, with all the tons of evidence we are collecting now, politicians will not be able to say we didn’t know.”

Well, yes, Dr.Neira, that’s exactly what they will say, because that’s what those who fund their continued political careers will require them to say so in order to keep the flow of campaign dollars flowing.

The difference is that whereas before climate activists could only talk about some inchoate climate emergency, starving polar bears, and thinning ice shelves at the poles, now we can say “STOP POLLUTING OUR BODIES AND KILLING OUR CHILDREN!” Those are words that even the most feckless politician can understand.

The solution should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. Electrify everything with renewable energy and stop burning fossil fuels. D’uh.","Air Pollution Is Slowly Killing Us All, New Global Study Claims"

Try $18.3 billion statewide, $2,559 per driver in the Chicago area.And you don't have to go far to find why: rough and congested roads, and a lack of safety features according to TRIP, a Washington non-profit research group made up of transportation industry stakeholders.In 2017 there were 462 deaths on Chicago area roads alone.""The lack of adequate roadway safety design, good lighting, better pedestrian and bicycle facilities, rumble strips on some roads, and better intersection design,"" said Rocky Morretti, director of policy and research with TRIP. ""All of these can contribute to keeping people significantly safer.""Morretti spoke at a news conference at the offices of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, where ICC official Candace Gerritsen stressed people have to care about the report entitled, ""Illinois Transportation: By the Numbers.""""We encourage our legislators to take the results of this report seriously and take swift action on a bipartisan basis in a transportation modernization program in the next two weeks,"" she said.The report shows Chicago drivers pay an additional $633 in vehicle costs, $387 in safety-related expenses and $1,539 in lost time and fuel due to congestion. That's how you get to $2,559 per driver. Statewide TRIP says that comes to $18.3 billion lost.The congestion issue in Chicago is especially well illustrated at the Jane Byrne Interchange, the most congested interchange in the entire United States, according to the federal government.

450,HEALTH,"Your mother was right; broccoli is good for you.

Long associated with decreased risk of cancer, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables -- the family of plants that also includes cauliflower, cabbage, collard greens, Brussels sprouts and kale -- contain a molecule that inactivates a gene known to play a role in a variety of common human cancers. In a new paper published today in Science, researchers, led by Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, Director of the Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, demonstrate that targeting the gene, known as WWP1, with the ingredient found in broccoli suppressed tumor growth in cancer-prone lab animals.

""We found a new important player that drives a pathway critical to the development of cancer, an enzyme that can be inhibited with a natural compound found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables,"" said Pandolfi. ""This pathway emerges not only as a regulator for tumor growth control, but also as an Achilles' heel we can target with therapeutic options.""

A well-known and potent tumor suppressive gene, PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated, deleted, down-regulated or silenced tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. Certain inherited PTEN mutations can cause syndromes characterized by cancer susceptibility and developmental defects. But because complete loss of the gene triggers an irreversible and potent failsafe mechanism that halts proliferation of cancer cells, both copies of the gene (humans have two copies of each gene; one from each parent) are rarely affected. Instead, tumor cells exhibit lower levels of PTEN, raising the question whether restoring PTEN activity to normal levels in the cancer setting can unleash the gene's tumor suppressive activity.

To find out, Pandolfi and colleagues identified the molecules and compounds regulating PTEN function and activation. Carrying out a series of experiments in cancer prone mice and human cells, the team revealed that a gene called WWP1 -- which is also known to play a role in the development of cancer -- produces an enzyme that inhibits PTEN's tumor suppressive activity. How to disable this PTEN kryptonite? By analyzing the enzyme's physical shape, the research team's chemists recognized that a small molecule -- formally named indole-3-carbinol (I3C), an ingredient in broccoli and its relatives -- could be the key to quelling the cancer causing effects of WWP1.

When Pandolfi and colleagues tested this idea by administering I3C to cancer prone lab animals, the scientists found that the naturally occurring ingredient in broccoli inactivated WWP1, releasing the brakes on the PTEN's tumor suppressive power.

But don't head to the farmer's market just yet; first author Yu-Ru Lee, PhD, a member of the Pandolfi lab, notes you'd have to eat nearly 6 pounds of Brussels sprouts a day -- and uncooked ones at that -- to reap their potential anti-cancer benefit. That's why the Pandolfi team is seeking other ways to leverage this new knowledge. The team plans to further study the function of WWP1 with the ultimate goal of developing more potent WWP1 inhibitors.

""Either genetic or pharmacological inactivation of WWP1 with either CRISPR technology or I3C could restore PTEN function and further unleash its tumor suppressive activity,"" said Pandolfi. ""These findings pave the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor reactivation approach to cancer treatment.""

451,HEALTH,"(PJ Media) This week, The New England Journal of Medicine published a bizarre story. A “transgender man” entered a hospital with severe abdominal pains. Because she was identified as a man, the doctors naturally did not think to treat her for labor and delivery, so she tragically lost the baby. Rather than emphasizing the danger of placing gender identity over biological sex, both the journal and The Washington Post made the absurd claim that the hospital should not have ruled out pregnancy for a man.

“He was rightly classified as a man” in the medical records and appears masculine, Dr. Daphna Stroumsa at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, wrote in the journal article. “But that classification threw us off from considering his actual medical needs.”

“The point is not what’s happened to this particular individual but this is an example of what happened to transgender people interacting with the health care system,” she added.",Baby dies because mother's medical records listed her as male
452,HEALTH,"Doctors fighting an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being forced to wear disguises in case they're attacked by militiamen.

Health workers are ditching their scrubs and wearing plain clothes in an effort to conceal their identities and avoid conflict.

Others are riding on motorbikes that blend into traffic instead of medical jeeps that could draw attention to them.

'Our staff has to lie about being doctors in order to treat people,' Tariq Riebel, emergency response director for the International Rescue Committee (IRC), told The Washington Post.

The Congo is currently facing the second deadliest outbreak of the killer virus ever, with the death toll climbing to 1,161 on Thursday.

The infection count, meanwhile, has shot to 1,760, Congo's Ministry of Health said.

Armed militiamen believe Ebola is a conspiracy against them and have repeatedly attacked health workers battling the epidemic.

There have been 119 attacks this year against aid workers, with eighty-five being wounded or killed, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

It comes as aid groups warn they could run out of money in weeks.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that unless it gets more funding it won't be able to continue providing support to crews burying Ebola victims.

Funerals were a major source of virus transmission during the worst ever Ebola epidemic in 2014-2016.

Each Ebola burial costs the equivalent of £400 for, among other things, the protective gear for workers.

The Congo Ebola epidemic has escalated sharply over the past month.

The health ministry says 20 per cent of all cases since August have been reported in just the last three weeks.

Health experts warn that because of security issues it has been difficult getting into some areas to vaccinate those most at risk.

WHO WARNS IT MAY RUN OUT OF MONEY FIGHTING EBOLA OUTBREAK The World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned the UN body is short of around $104million (£80m) it needs to keep fighting Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The funding gap must be filled so health workers can continue battling the virus to the end of July and beyond, Science reported. 'We cannot intensify our efforts if we do not have enough funds,' Dr Tedros said. 'The current funding gap has meant that we have had to slow down preparedness activities in neighboring countries.' The UK's International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, echoed Dr Tedros's sentiment and said other countries need to step up and contribute more. She said this month: 'The UK has been a major donor since the start. But this outbreak requires a truly global response if we're to stop this threat. 'It's time for other countries to step up. Diseases like this do not respect borders and it's in all of our interests to help contain the spread of Ebola.' The UK Government has refused to disclose how much it is contributing to the effort.

Last month an attack on a hospital in Butembo killed a Cameroonian epidemiologist working for the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO said a surge in cases showed the current strategy of vaccinating those known to be directly exposed to the virus was no longer working.

More than 111,000 people have already received the protective jab, through a so-called ring vaccination approach.

But this has not proved enough to stop the highly contagious virus from spreading in regions of DRC wracked with insecurity.

Health workers have implemented a 'ring' strategy, vaccinating anyone directly exposed to known cases of Ebola, and a second ring of those exposed to people in the first ring.

'The number of new cases continues to rise, in part due to repeated incidents of violence affecting the ability of response teams to immediately identify and create vaccination rings around all people at risk of contracting Ebola,' the WHO said in a statement.

WHO experts have suggested giving the vaccine to entire neighbourhoods and villages where cases have been reported within the past 21 days.

Last week experts warned the outbreak in the Congo could end up as disastrous as the West Africa epidemic of 2014.

Dr Osman Dar, a global health expert at Chatham House and member of the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh and Public Health England, said the death toll could spiral to rival the 11,310 who were killed in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone five years ago, he said.

On April 28, the Congo experienced its most devastating outbreak so far, with a record 27 cases diagnosed in a single day.

Dr Dar told MailOnline a lack of security where the outbreak is happening is the 'key issue' facing the organisations trying to stop it.

The 2014 outbreak in West Africa began when an 18-month-old boy in Guinea got infected by a bat in December 2013, and the illness quickly spread to neighbouring countries.

By the time the World Health Organization released its first situation report in August 2014, more than 3,000 people had been infected and 1,546 killed.

A year later the number of cases had rocketed to 28,073 and 11,290 people had died.",Doctors fighting Ebola in Congo are wearing disguises to avoid gunfire
453,HEALTH,"It’s a big world and there’s a lot of drinking going on, but the citizen’s of one country are getting drunk more than the citizens of any other country. The winner (?) of this dubious distinction is the United Kingdom.

British people are getting drunk more often than any other nation in the world, and not just tipsy but completely intoxicated. This is according to the 2019 Global Drug Survey published Thursday which analyzed the behavior of 123,814 people from 36 countries.

On average, respondents said they got drunk 33 times in the last 12 months with drinkers from the UK reporting being drunk 51 times in last year. The U.S. was not far behind, with respondents claiming to have been intoxicated 50 times in the last year, followed by Canada's drinkers who overindulged 48 times in the last year and Australia's respondents who got drunk 47 times.

Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the spectrum, people in Chile reported getting drunk just 16 times a year while in Germany and Colombia respondents indulged 33 times in the last year.

Commenting on the results, Adam Winstock, an addiction psychiatrist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, told CNN that British drinkers did not know where to draw the line.

""We have never grasped moderation – it's not part of our culture or conversation,"" he said. ""We need to learn that more fun with better health and fatter wallets can follow from a bit less, a bit less often.""

Winstock noted, while people are often told that drinking too much is bad for their health, current guidelines are not distinguishing the difference between ""being a little drunk and a lot drunk, and doing it three to four times a year versus weekly,"" The Guardian reported.

What nearly half the participants did agree upon though, is wanting to drink less in the next 12 years to come – a decision that could benefit people from all nations.

454,HEALTH,"U.S. drug czar James Carroll is preparing to travel to China later this year to check whether the government is keeping its promise to crack down on fentanyl production and trafficking.

Most of the illicit fentanyl – an often lethal substance that is 50 times more potent than heroin, and up to 100 times stronger than morphine – found in the United States comes from China. Fentanyl has driven up the number of overdose deaths to a record level.

“I’ll be going to China later this year,” Carroll told Fox News in a wide-ranging interview. “I’m going to meet with government officials. I want to see that they’re actually cracking down on the fentanyl producers, and that they’re putting them in jail. [I want] to make sure that they’re actually enforcing this.”

China recently announced that beginning this month, it would regulate all fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances. Previously, under pressure from the United States, China classified some substances used to make fentanyl as controlled substances, but people and organizations involved in manufacturing the drug got around those laws by using other materials.

""We now need to make them live up to that agreement so that they will stop sending that drug out of China to the U.S.,"" Carroll said of China's promised new regulatory move. ""[Chinese officials] absolutely have a role, they have to step up, they have to be aggressive. If they want to maintain a good relationship with the U.S., they have to take us seriously. The Chinese government has to do more, they have to stop spreading this poison around the country.""

Drug overdose deaths have reached such an alarming rate in the country that in some areas morgues are operating at capacity, and many Americans know someone, or know of someone, whose life was cut short because of the epidemic.

“Business cannot go on as normal,” said Carroll, whose official title is Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). “These drugs are coming in and are killing 70,000 Americans a year. That’s like one commercial airplane going down every day.”

President Trump said that during the G-20 summit in Argentina late last year, he pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to get tougher about the illicit fentanyl market in China.

U.S. officials have been leery of China’s assurances over the years that it is making an earnest effort at cracking down on producers and traffickers of fentanyl. On the one hand, Chinese officials have said they would help combat the role of its citizens in the black market fueling the epidemic, and on the other hand, they often have expressed skepticism that the crisis is as dire as U.S. officials described it to them.

In the Chinese government’s announcement about classifying all fentanyl-related derivatives, officials made a point of casting doubt on the existence of an overdose crisis and also of blaming the U.S. appetite for drugs.

“China’s control over fentanyl drugs is very strict,” said Liu Yuejin, vice commissioner of the National Narcotics Control Commission, according to The New York Times. “It cannot be the main source for the United States. The U.S. accusation lacks evidence and is contrary to the facts.”

“We believe that the United States is the main cause of the problem of the abuse of fentanyl in the United States,” Yuejin said, adding that the United States consumed 80 percent of the world’s opioids while making up only 5 percent of the world’s population.

“The Chinese are not a friend on this issue,” Carroll said to Fox News. “They’re becoming the drug dealer of the world.”

Carroll said that Mexico's government, for its part, also has to make a more serious effort to dismantle the drug manufacturing and trafficking underworld.

But Carroll said the illegal drug trade in both China and Mexico breed corruption, perhaps tempting some authorities to look the other way and remain silent.

Asked if he thought that was why neither government seemed to be doing enough in the view of the U.S., Carroll said: ""Certainly there a lot of people who are benefitting. There's a lot of money involved in the sale and production of fentanyl. We know corruption is widespread in China. That about the best I can say.""

Longtime China observers believe that it will take more than helping to fight drug addiction and fatalities to motivate Beijing to mount a meaningful fight against the fentanyl black market.

“They are not going to do it, the record says, unless they get a trade deal, or we threaten them in the absence of a trade deal,” said Derek Scissors, an expert on Sino-U.S. economic relations at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, to Reuters. “They can stop this if they want, but they won’t unless they see a deal.”

Mexico also is rife with corruption, Carroll said, adding: ""There are some great people in Mexico who want to clean up, who don't want to be known [for] this.""

""But we're doing our part, they need to do theirs.""

The Drug Enforcement Administration has said that Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels are the main distributors of fentanyl produced in China. Once it is sold in the U.S., often it is mixed into other drugs, or pressed into counterfeit pills made to mimic prescription medication, unbeknownst to the person who consumes it. Fentanyl increasingly is getting into the U.S. via the postal service, posing a great challenge to investigators.

Drug overdose deaths linked to fentanyl saw a sharp rise from 2013 through 2016, doubling each year, according to new data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths was roughly the same, slightly more than 1,600, in 2011 and 2012, they rose to nearly 2,000 in 2013 and by 2016 had reached 18,335, the CDC said. The year 2016 was the latest year analyzed in the data.

Death certificates citing an overdose mentioned fentanyl more than any other drugs. Often, fentanyl was found along with heroin or cocaine.

Other CDC studies have showed that fatalities involving fentanyl accounted for some 28,000 of about 70,000 overdose deaths of all kinds in 2017.

""We're heading over to China to make sure that they're enforcing [laws and regulations],"" Carroll said. ""They know President Trump is serious about this, they know I'm serious. It's their time to show the world that they're not to be a [global] drug dealer.""",Exclusive: U.S. drug czar to travel to China to press government to stop fentanyl trafficking
455,HEALTH,"A team of Swedish and British scientists have studied the heritability of dog ownership using information from 35,035 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry. The new study suggests that genetic variation explains more than half of the variation in dog ownership, implying that the choice of getting a dog is heavily influenced by an individual's genetic make-up.

Dogs were the first domesticated animal and have had a close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years. Today, dogs are common pets in our society and are considered to increase the well-being and health of their owners. The team compared the genetic make-up of twins (using the Swedish Twin Registry -- the largest of its kind in the world) with dog ownership. The results are published for the first time in Scientific Reports. The goal was to determine whether dog ownership has a heritable component.

""We were surprised to see that a person's genetic make-up appears to be a significant influence in whether they own a dog. As such, these findings have major implications in several different fields related to understanding dog-human interaction throughout history and in modern times. Although dogs and other pets are common household members across the globe, little is known how they impact our daily life and health. Perhaps some people have a higher innate propensity to care for a pet than others."" says Tove Fall, lead author of the study, and Professor in Molecular Epidemiology at the Department of Medical Sciences and the Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University.

Carri Westgarth, Lecturer in Human-Animal interaction at the University of Liverpool and co-author of the study, adds: ""These findings are important as they suggest that supposed health benefits of owning a dog reported in some studies may be partly explained by different genetics of the people studied.""

Studying twins is a well-known method for disentangling the influences of environment and genes on our biology and behaviour. Because identical twins share their entire genome, and non-identical twins on average share only half of the genetic variation, comparisons of the within-pair concordance of dog ownership between groups can reveal whether genetics play a role in owning a dog. The researchers found concordance rates of dog ownership to be much larger in identical twins than in non-identical ones -- supporting the view that genetics indeed plays a major role in the choice of owning a dog.

""These kind of twin studies cannot tell us exactly which genes are involved, but at least demonstrate for the first time that genetics and environment play about equal roles in determining dog ownership. The next obvious step is to try to identify which genetic variants affect this choice and how they relate to personality traits and other factors such as allergy"" says Patrik Magnusson, senior author of the study and Associate Professor in Epidemiology at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Karolinska Insitutet, Sweden and Head of the Swedish Twin Registry.

456,HEALTH,"SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) - Overdose deaths declined across the state last year, but that wasn't the case in parts of western Massachusetts.

The Department of Public Health found that overdose deaths decreased slightly state-wide, but those deaths doubled in one part of western Massachusetts.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health recorded a one-percent decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths in 2018, almost all of them involved fentanyl. But Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties all saw significant increases in drug deaths last year.

""I'm not a notorious nefarious heroin addict,” said Jessie Estello of Greenfield. “I've been there, I've done it. But you know what? Other people need help. I'm 53-years-old, trust me I take care of business. But other people aren't like me, they need help.”

From 2017 to 2018, the study found a 144 percent increase in overdose deaths in Franklin County, an 84 percent increase in Hampshire County, and a nearly 30 percent increase in Hampden County.

The study also broke down deaths, city-by-city. They found 108 overdoses occurred in Springfield in 2018 overall, but only 80 of those people were from Springfield.

“Numbers are a little bit skewed,” said Ryan Walsh, spokesman of the Springfield Police Department. “So, if someone came to Baystate or Mercy and died here in the city, those numbers would count against the city of Springfield.”

Walsh said the department's own overdose numbers don't match up with DPH.

“Obviously there is a heroin epidemic, there is an opioid crisis,” Walsh added. “We do see it, we just see the trends like that. The numbers our crime analysts have do not reflect anywhere near that kind of trend.”

Springfield Police just started carrying Narcan two months ago. Walsh said officers have already saved 10 people with the drug so far.

457,HEALTH,"The gene responsible for causing breathing problems and wheezing in short-nosed dogs has been identified by scientists.

Future short-nosed dogs may not suffer with the chronic breathing problems they are infamous for as a result, they say.

Scientists have discovered a DNA mutation that could be behind their notorious wheezing.

The faulty gene is linked with fluid retention and causes the lining of the airways to swell.

Genetic tests looking at the ADAMTS3 gene could help vets identify animals at risk and help breeders avoid producing affected pups.

It has long been believed the desire of owners for squat skulls and a scrunched up face led to the problem, but this study casts doubt on that belief.

It is found in popular flat-nosed dog breeds such as French and English Bulldogs, pugs and the Norwich terrier, which has a proportional nose but suffers with the same issues.

The discovery means the shape of the breed's skull may not be the only factor causing breathing hardship for dogs.

Many of the dogs with shortened noses are affected by a condition called Bracycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome, or BOAS.

This can often leave dogs gasping and short of breath.

Dr Jeffrey Schoenebeck and his team at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies analysed DNA from more than 400 Norwich terriers.

Vets also carried out clinical examinations of the dogs to check their airways for signs of disease.

The mutated version of the gene was also common in French and English bulldogs, which may help to explain why some dogs of these breeds develop breathing problems and complications after surgery to treat them.

Dr Schoenebeck said: 'We conclude that there are additional genetic risk factors, that if inherited, will likely lead to airway disease in dogs regardless of their face shape.

'The challenge ahead is to integrate these ideas, and implement sensible breeding practices and treatments that consider various health risks including those presented by the mutation of ADAMTS3. BOAS is a complex disease.

'Although skull shape remains an important risk factor, our study suggests that the status of ADAMTS3 should be considered as well.

'More studies are needed to dissect the complex nature of this devastating disease.'

Senior specialist surgeon Dr Jon Hall, who leads a specialist clinic for dogs with upper airway problems called BREATHE, said: 'This discovery is a step change in our understanding of upper airway problems in dogs, which we hope will allow us to identify dogs at greater risk of catastrophic airway swelling before it happens.'

Along with helping dog breeders be safer in their practices, screening for the mutation may also help veterinarians identify dogs which are at risk of UAS, and in particular identify the dogs at risk of swelling of their airways after surgical treatment, which is a common, life-threatening post-operative complication.

The findings were published in the journal PLOS Genetics.",Scientists discover gene which could fix Bulldog breathing issues

459,HEALTH,"Earlier this week, several articles warned of a new report from a French government agency outlining dangers of blue light from LED lighting.

These headlines are alarming because, depending on the time of day and your phone or computer’s settings, your eyes are being exposed to blue light right now. LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are hugely popular—they’re more energy-efficient than traditional lights, and 90% cheaper now than they were a decade ago. All screens have LEDs that emit blue light, as do many offices and homes.

The press release (in French) put out by the Agency for Food, Environment, Occupational Health, and Safety is dire. Authors of the report claim their work “confirms the toxicity of blue light on the retina” while also showing that blue light can seriously disturb sleep-related biological rhythms. Not only that, but it says that there are environmental risks to blue light from LED screens, too.

Oh boy. Danger is everywhere and eminent, it would seem. And yet, if you dig a little deeper, you’ll find you can take a sigh of relief. What the report gets right is that blue light from screens can affect our bodies and the environment. But the risks to typical screen-users eye health is seriously overstated, both by the agency’s own report and press release, and in the news headlines that followed. Let’s break it down.

Blue light is a component of light present in the normal visible spectrum. It’s on the shorter end of wavelengths we can see, around 400 to 500 nanometers. For context, red light is about 635 to 700 nanometers. Like its name implies, when blue light is reflected off a surface, we see the color blue. White light is a combination of all the different wavelengths of light we can see, and is given off by lamps, screens, and the sun.

There are plenty of wavelengths we can’t see that can be dangerous. Ultra-violet (UV) rays, which the sun also emits, are shorter than the visible spectrum and have enough energy to degrade our DNA. Infrared light is light we can’t see because its wavelengths are too long, but we can feel them in the form of heat. They can also burn us, but they won’t harm our DNA in the same way as shorter wavelengths do.

LED lights, however, do not emit UV or infrared lights. They only emit visible light.

Yes—but no more blue light (pdf) than other lightbulbs, provided they give off the same balance of shorter and longer light wavelengths. “Warmer” light has more of a yellow tone to it, while “cooler” light, which is similar to daylight, appears a little bluer.

Sunlight is 10 times brighter than typical indoor LED light or screen, which means we get much more blue light exposure from the outdoors.

In the vast majority of cases, no.

The risks to eye health from light exposure come down to brightness. The retina of our eyes have cells called photoreceptors, which pick up light. Too much light can damage these cells.

All LED lighting is rated on its safety on a scale of 0 to 3 used by both the American National Standards Institute and the International Electrotechnical Commission to bring uniformity to LED light labeling. “0” means that the light poses no risk to your eyes, and doesn’t require any kind of warning label. The LED lights present in homes, offices, and your screens, have this kind of a low-risk rating.

The eye-health risks posed by lamps increase as the scale goes up; but notably, those that are high-risk, with a rating of 2 or 3, are usually only present in industrial settings. People who work with these types of lights are required to wear protective gear to filter out some of the blue light. Because blue light has the shortest wavelengths of visible light, there’s some concern that, like UV rays, they could also damage the retina.

Most of us will only ever experience blue light from the LEDs in screens and from ambient lighting—safer settings. Although there are some concerns that LED lighting could lead to vision problems later in life, the science behind these theories is weak. The risks to damaging our eye health from these sources are “negligible” compared to the risks to eye health from smoking, cardiovascular disease, or even regular aging, according to an article from Harvard Medical School.

Does that mean I can look directly into an LED lightbulb?

When you look into any bright light, like those in headlights of a car or a camera flash, your retinas’ photoreceptors panic. “We call it a ‘blanching of the photoreceptors’,” says Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist based in Carmel, Indiana, and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Basically, these cells all fire at once, and need a second to recover afterward.

When exposure to a bright light is brief, it takes our photoreceptors only a second or so to recover before we can see clearly again. In older adults, particularly those with other eye conditions, the recovery period may be a little longer—a few seconds or so, which could create dangerous driving situations.

If you continue to look at a bright light (despite your eyes’ instinct telling you to stop), your photoreceptors will become so overwhelmed they release stress chemicals that can damage nearby tissue. It can take up to a year for this kind of damage to heal.

In addition to damaging your photoreceptors, staring into the sun can also damage the eye with the UV rays it emits. Do. Not. Do. It. No matter how cool you think it may look during an eclipse.

Okay, okay—so if I don’t look directly into an LED light, it’s totally safe?

The French regulatory agency was right in pointing out that blue light from LEDs can mess with our circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are our body’s natural hormone cycles that tell us when to be awake and when to be asleep.

When our photoreceptors pick up blue light, they interpret it as daylight, and therefore time to be awake. When they don’t perceive blue light—and blue light specifically—it’s a signal that it’s nighttime, and therefore time to produce melatonin, a hormone that helps us sleep.

Staring at screens late into the evening can trick our bodies into thinking that it’s still daytime, and delay melatonin production. The best way to keep sleep cycles on track is to put any screens on “night shift” mode, Maturi says. This setting filters out blue light (and makes the screen look a little more orange).

The French government report also points out the risks of LEDs to the environment. It’s not wrong: Light pollution is a serious problem. When LEDs light up the sky for our benefit, they mess with local fauna, from birds to turtles, who use light and darkness as signals for when certain activities are meant to take place.

And although this is not a point in the report, it’s worth noting that LED bulbs also contain heavy metals. In the bulb, these pose no threat to us. But when these lights break in a home or office setting, it’s important not to touch them as you clean up, although they can be safely sent to a landfill. If disposed LED lights make it into other settings, like a river, they could harm the animals living there.

But back to my eyes—if my LED screens are safe, why do my eyes hurt when I look at screens for a long time?

Assuming you have otherwise healthy eyeballs, muscle strain.

Eyeballs are restless, curious organs. Their preferred state is looking around to take in all kinds of information about your setting, both near and far. It’s hard for them to focus on one close point for long periods of time, like you may do while reading articles far longer than this one.

The pain you feel after looking at a screen is a simple strain on the muscles around and near the eye, explained Maturi. You can give these muscles a break by looking at something farther away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes or so.",The blue light from your LED screen isn’t hurting your eyes
460,HEALTH,"Instead of searching for a needle in a haystack, what if you were able to sweep the entire haystack to one side, leaving only the needle behind? That's the strategy researchers in the University of Georgia College of Engineering followed in developing a new microfluidic device that separates elusive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a sample of whole blood.

CTCs break away from cancerous tumors and flow through the bloodstream, potentially leading to new metastatic tumors. The isolation of CTCs from the blood provides a minimally invasive alternative for basic understanding, diagnosis and prognosis of metastatic cancer. But most studies are limited by technical challenges in capturing intact and viable CTCs with minimal contamination.

""A typical sample of 7 to 10 milliliters of blood may contain only a few CTCs,"" said Leidong Mao, a professor in UGA's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the project's principal investigator. ""They're hiding in whole blood with millions of white blood cells. It's a challenge to get our hands on enough CTCs so scientists can study them and understand them.""

Circulating tumor cells are also difficult to isolate because within a sample of a few hundred CTCs, the individual cells may present many characteristics. Some resemble skin cells while others resemble muscle cells. They can also vary greatly in size.

""People often compare finding CTCs to finding a needle in a haystack,"" said Mao. ""But sometimes the needle isn't even a needle.""

To more quickly and efficiently isolate these rare cells for analysis, Mao and his team have created a new microfluidic chip that captures nearly every CTC in a sample of blood—more than 99% - a considerably higher percentage than most existing technologies.

The team calls its novel approach to CTC detection ""integrated ferrohydrodynamic cell separation,"" or iFCS. They outline their findings in a study published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's Lab on a Chip.

The new device could be ""transformative"" in the treatment of breast cancer, according to Melissa Davis, an assistant professor of cell and developmental biology at Weill Cornell Medicine and a collaborator on the project.

""Physicians can only treat what they can detect,"" Davis said. ""We often can't detect certain subtypes of CTCs, but with the iFCS device we will capture all the subtypes of CTCs and even determine which subtypes are the most informative concerning relapse and disease progression.""

Davis believes the device may ultimately allow physicians to gauge a patient's response to specific treatments much earlier than is currently possible.

While most efforts to capture circulating tumor cells focus on identifying and isolating the few CTCs lurking in a blood sample, the iFCS takes a completely different approach by eliminating everything in the sample that's not a circulating tumor cell.

The device, about the size of a USB drive, works by funneling blood through channels smaller in diameter than a human hair. To prepare blood for analysis, the team adds micron-sized magnetic beads to the samples. The white blood cells in the sample attach themselves to these beads. As blood flows through the device, magnets on the top and bottom of the chip draw the white blood cells and their magnetic beads down a specific channel while the circulating tumor cells continue into another channel.

The device combines three steps in one microfluidic chip, another advance over existing technologies that require separate devices for various steps in the process.

""The first step is a filter that removes large debris in the blood,"" said Yang Liu, a doctoral student in UGA's department of chemistry and the paper's co-lead author. ""The second part depletes extra magnetic beads and the majority of the white blood cells. The third part is designed to focus remaining white blood cells to the middle of channel and to push CTCs to the side walls.""

Wujun Zhao is the paper's other lead author. Zhao, a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, worked on the project while completing his doctorate in chemistry at UGA.

""The success of our integrated device is that it has the capability to enrich almost all CTCs regardless of their size profile or antigen expression,"" said Zhao. ""Our findings have the potential to provide the cancer research community with key information that may be missed by current protein-based or size-based enrichment technologies.""

The researchers say their next steps include automating the iFCS and making it more user-friendly for clinical settings. They also need to put the device through its paces in patient trials. Mao and his colleagues hope additional collaborators will join them and lend their expertise to the project.",Scientists develop technology to capture tumor cells
461,HEALTH,"Changes in gene activity in specific brain cells are associated with the severity of autism in children and young adults with the disorder, according to a UC San Francisco study of postmortem brain tissue. The study's new insights into how specific changes in gene expression contribute to the disease's symptoms by altering the function of brain circuits provides an important foundation for the development of treatments for the disorder, the authors say.

Scientists have learned in recent years that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are typically caused by changes in the genetic instructions for how the developing brain wires itself up, beginning in the second trimester of pregnancy and continuing through early childhood. It is far less clear how the mature brain circuitry produced by those garbled instructions differs in people with autism or how these changes produce the social communication difficulties; restricted, repetitive behaviors; and other symptoms that define the disorder. This is one of the reasons there are currently no medical therapies to reverse or treat these symptoms, say the authors of the new study.

""Identifying genetic changes that occur at conception or in utero is important for understanding the causes of autism, but these insights are unlikely to result in useful therapeutic targets,"" said senior author Arnold Kriegstein, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neuroscience who directs UCSF's Eli and Edyth Broad Center for Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research. ""By the time children are diagnosed with autism, all of the things that went wrong have happened already, and the patients are left with a circuit dysfunction that has now matured. If we want to be able to offer treatments to these children when they come to our attention, it's the altered brain circuits that we're going to have to tackle.""

In the new study -- published in the May 17, 2019 issue of Science -- researchers led by Dmitry Velmeshev, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Kriegstein's lab, set out to understand how the brains of people diagnosed with autism differ from non-autistic brains at the neural circuit level by using novel techniques to look for differences in gene activity in specific types of brain cells.

Studying single-cell differences in gene expression by sequencing molecules of RNA -- which reveal which genes are turned on in particular cells -- has been the frontier of biology in recent years, but has been hard to apply to adult brain tissue, since teasing out individual cells from the elaborately tangled circuitry of the brain is a bit like playing Jenga with Jell-o. Instead, Velmeshev and colleagues used even newer techniques to extract RNA from cell nuclei isolated from samples of brain tissue and then identify the type of cell the genetic material had come from after the fact based on signature patterns of gene expression. This allowed the researchers to look for biological differences in specific cell types and circuit components in the brains of individuals with autism.

The researchers applied this single-nuclei sequencing approach to snap-frozen post-mortem samples of prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex -- two brain regions previously shown to behave differently in patients with autism -- provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NeuroBioBank and University of Maryland School of Medicine Brain and Tissue Bank. They compared brain samples from 15 people with autism who died between the ages of four and 22 with brain samples from 16 people who died in the same age range of non-neurological causes. Since many of the patients with autism also suffered from seizures, the researchers also examined brain samples from patients with epilepsy to identify brain changes more likely to stem from seizures than from autism itself.

Their analysis of more than 100,000 cell nuclei from these brain samples found that brains of people with autism contained a common set of changes in genes involved in synaptic communication between neurons. These changes were found specifically in cells in the uppermost layers of the neocortex that are responsible for local information processing. They also found changes in non-neuronal brain cells called glia that could impact their role in pruning and maintaining healthy neural circuits.

Many of the genes the researchers found to be expressed differently in the brains of people with autism are known to be widely expressed across the entire brain, but only in these cells did they appear to be significantly altered in the disease. Remarkably, the extent of changes in gene expression in these very specific groups of cells was closely correlated with the severity of patients' behavioral symptoms.

Researchers have long feared that a disorder with such diverse symptoms and genetic causes as ASDs would be so variable at the neurological level that each individual would essentially require a unique form of treatment. The fact that the researchers were able to identify a common set of circuit changes among a diverse set of patients of different ages and genetic backgrounds offers new hope that one day there could be a common treatment for many people with the disorder.

""It was very exciting to see such clear convergence on specific cell types that appear to be altered in all of these patients,"" Velmeshev said. ""This offers hope that some point in the future there could be a widely applicable therapy for many different patients with the disease.""

On the other hand, Velmeshev and Kriegstein noted that the finding that these common genetic changes are highly specific to certain cell types in the brain presents a significant challenge, as any treatment would also have to be exquisitely specific to these affected cell types.

To better understand exactly how the specific cellular changes they identified in this study impact the functioning of neural circuits in patients with autism, the researchers plan to recreate these alterations in three-dimensional ""organoid"" models of brain development that can be grown in the lab from patients' skin cells.

""It's important to remember that we are looking at downstream effects of changes that occurred during early brain development, so the changes we are seeing are likely a mix of the actual causes of autism symptoms as well as ways these neurons are trying to compensate to maintain normal activity,"" Velmeshev said. ""Figuring out exactly which of these changes are the best potential targets for therapies is one of the many questions this new kind of data is opening up for future study.""

462,HEALTH,"NORTH WINDHAM, CT (WFSB) - A case of tuberculosis has prompted school officials in Windham to take action.

Windham Public Schools said the case was confirmed at the Charles H. Barrows STEM Academy in North Windham.

A letter was sent to parents on Wednesday saying a plan of action is in place, in accordance with guidelines from the state Department of Public Health and local health authorities.

""The affected individual is being treated at this time and there is no risk of additional exposure to any students or staff at this time,"" wrote Patricia Sulk, director of health for the North Central District Health Department and principal Timothy Maclure.

The letter informed parents that it usually takes 8 hours of close contact in a small room for tuberculosis to be transmitted.

""A healthy person cannot contract TB from casual exposure such as passing in a hall or sitting in a cafeteria for an hour,"" Sulk and Maclure said.

The two said the risk that another child has become infected as a result of the exposure was very small.

However, state health officials recommend the testing of all students and staff who were in any class or after-school activity with the individual during the time of exposure.

""If testing is indicated for your child, you will be contacted via another letter within the next week,"" Sulk and Maclure wrote.

They said testing is recommended to take place now and in 8 to 10 weeks.

District officials said that although families may opt to have their preferred provider or doctor conduct this test, a clinic will take place on May 28 and May 29 at Barrows during school hours.

A national expert said tuberculosis is a bacteria that can spread but it's not easy to catch.

""Tuberculosis is not that infectious, so we’re not talking about measles. It requires being exposed to somebody who is sick for a prolonged period of time. Most healthy people who are exposed to somebody with tuberculosis will not be infected,"" said Lynn Sosa, Tuberculosis Program Coordinator for the state's Dept. of Public Health.

A cough, weight loss, night sweats, and a fever are just some of the symptoms.

""Representatives from [DPH and the local health district] will join school officials in hosting at health school community information forum on Thursday, May 23 at 6 p.m.,"" Windham Public Schools wrote on its website. ""We invite all families to attend that are seeking additional information.""

The Department of Public Health said they are coordinating a response together with the North Central Health District and Windham Public Schools on identifying persons who may have been recently exposed to tuberculosis.

“Together with local health officials, we have determined that currently there is no ongoing TB exposure at the school,” Sosa said. “More information will be provided to parents next week specifically addressing priority individuals who are recommended to be tested for the disease. School and health officials will also be offering parents an informational meeting to address any questions or concerns they have, including when testing will be provided. There are very few reported cases of Tuberculosis every year, but it is a public health issue we take very seriously in conjunction with our local health frontline partners.”

464,HEALTH,"There has been encouraging news from the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR), with scientists believing cancer could be made ‘manageable’ and ‘more curable’ within the next decade.

ICR scientists believe that the next 10 years will see medication capable of stopping cancer cells from becoming resistant to treatment.

It’s hoped these groundbreaking drugs will improve life expectancy and quality of life among cancer patients, preventing the disease from adapting and evolving.

Treatment resistance is reportedly the toughest challenge currently facing those working to fight cancer. Existing treatments – such as chemotherapy – sometimes fail because deadly cancer cells are able to adapt and mutate.

ICR scientists hope to address this challenge through ‘understanding, anticipating and overcoming cancer evolution’, focusing on a new approach known as ‘evolutionary herding’.

The ICR is now making an £75 million investment in a new Centre for Drug Discovery, and are appealing for a further £15 million to complete the project.

It is anticipated that nearly 300 scientists from a variety of fields will work together at this centre to fight against cancer’s evolution.

Chief Executive of the ICR, Professor Paul Workman, has made the following statement regarding the new centre:

We will create exciting new ways of meeting the challenge of cancer evolution head on, by blocking the entire process of evolutionary diversity, using AI and maths to herd cancer into more treatable forms, and tackling cancer with multi-drug combinations as used successfully against HIV and tuberculosis. We firmly believe that, with further research, we can find ways to make cancer a manageable disease in the long term and one that is more often curable, so patients can live longer and with a better quality of life. But that research will need support and our new Centre will dramatically accelerate the progress we’re already making.

Dr Olivia Rossanese, who will work as Head of Biology at the new Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery, stated:

This ‘Darwinian’ approach to drug discovery gives us the best chance yet of defeating cancer, because we will be able to predict what cancer is going to do next and get one step ahead. We’re especially excited by the potential of APOBEC inhibitors to slow down evolutionary diversity and drug resistance, and ensure our existing cancer drugs work for patients for much longer. We believe this will be the first treatment in the world that rather than dealing with the consequences of cancer’s evolution and resistance, aims to directly confront the disease’s ability to adapt and evolve in the first place.

466,HEALTH,"With summer just around the corner, it's time to talk UV.

The words ""UV protection"" is on sunscreen, hats, baby-friendly gear, beach tents and sunglasses. But what really protects us against UV rays — and what, for that matter, does UV actually mean?

To dive deeper into the topic of sun protection, TODAY Style sought out the expertise from the Skin Cancer Foundation and licensed estheticians. Before hitting the beach this summer, you'll be armed with information to take on UV like a pro.

Ultraviolet radiation, according to the SCF, is the ""electromagnetic (light) spectrum that reaches the earth from the sun."" Unlike physical sunlight, UV rays are invisible to the human eye, but that doesn't make them any less problematic for people enjoying a nice sun bath.

UV wavelengths are classified as UVA, UVB or UVC. UVA and UVB rays are the two that contribute most to premature skin aging, skin cancer and eye damage like cataracts.

UVA rays make up 95% of the UV radiation that reaches the earth's surface, so it's the type of UV radiation people are most affected by in daily life. The SCF reported that while UVA rays are less powerful than UVB, they are 30 to 50 times prevalent, are more intense during daylight hours and can penetrate clouds and glass (hence those one-shouldered sunburns while stuck in traffic).

UVA rays also penetrate the skin more deeply than UVB rays and cause long-term damage such as wrinkles and age spots. UVB affects the outermost layer of the skin and is what causes reddening and burns.

""You can remember what each does by the last letter: UVB(urn) and UVA(ging),"" esthetician Rosa Sollecito, owner of the Florida-based skin care line, AloeMoist Organics, told TODAY.

""Upon initial interaction with the skin, there is no change in feeling. Under the surface of the skin, they stimulate enzymes that break down structural proteins (such as collagen and elastin) and are the leading cause of skin's signs of aging caused by an external factor,"" Amanda von dem Hagen, a licensed esthetician and international educator for the Colorado-based skin care line Glo Skin Beauty, told TODAY.

""UVA rays also cause significant damage to skin cells in the basal layer of the epidermis, which is where most skin cancers occur,"" she continued.

UVB rays are responsible for sunburns and discoloration in the skin and, like UVA rays, can also cause skin cancers.

While UVB rays are present year-round, they are more detrimental during certain times of the year, depending on location, time of day and season. They can be reflected off surfaces like snow or ice, so they hit the skin twice.

According to the SCF, UVB hits the U.S. the strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. from April to October. Still, it's safe to lather up during the winter months, especially when hitting the slopes.

According to Dr. Tina Alster of the Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery, the most important thing to look for when shopping for sunscreen is the label ""mineral sunscreen."" Many drugstore sunscreens have synthetic ingredients made from chemicals to make them more affordable, but Alster noted some brands, like Neutrogena, have developed a mineral option.

Alster finds that sunscreens laden with other ingredients can cause breakouts easily, especially because the skin becomes more sensitive when exposed to the sun.

The other key ingredient to look for is zinc oxide.

""Some inorganic ingredients for protecting ourselves from the sun are minerals such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide; they act as a physical sunblock. They reflect UV rays. Of these two ingredients, I think zinc oxide is the safest as compared to titanium dioxide, which has toxic, heavy metal content,"" Sollecito told TODAY.

Sollecito advises looking for sunscreens with ""non-nano,"" or not micronized zinc oxide, as the sole active ingredient on the label. This also makes it a suitable sunscreen for children under 6 months of age.

For adults who may not want to limit their options, sunscreens with titanium dioxide are still approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Alster loves this mineral sunscreen that offers lightweight protection. She told TODAY one of the best things for women who are looking for a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen is to look for one that can act as makeup too. EltaMD offers a tinted or non-tinted option and is specifically formulated for the face.

""I use this as my foundation in the summer due to its higher SPF,"" Alster told TODAY.

The Revision line may be a bit of a splurge item, but it has anti-aging properties, protects skin against cancer, spots and burns and acts as makeup — so it's basically three products in one.

This sunscreen by the medical-grade skin care company La Roche-Posay is affordable and armed with the right ingredients. Alster enjoys that it comes in a tinted and non-tinted option.

MDSolarSciences stick sunscreens are a convenient way to ensure people continuously protect their skin. Alster keeps a stick of sunscreen in her car at all times for those pesky moments when sunlight shines a little too bright on one area. She also advises readily applying it to the nose, lips and areas surrounding the eye — all of which need a little extra TLC when it comes to UVA and UVB protection. The stick even comes in a kid-friendly version!

468,HEALTH,"Michigan is at a crisis point, according to a new report issued Wednesday by the Michigan Dementia Coalition.

Dementia care will cost as much as $1.42 billion this year alone to Medicaid in Michigan for people age 65 and older. That number is likely to rise to $1.72 billion annually within six years, as more people are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, according to the coalition's Roadmap for creating a Dementia Capable Michigan report.

""Every sector of our state is affected by this challenge,"" wrote Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a letter released Wednesday as part of the report. ""More than half a million Michigan family members are caring for a loved one with dementia, and they bear the greatest responsibility. But this impact is also felt by our employers, our healthcare systems, our state resources and economy, and every community in the state.""

The report paints a worrisome picture, showing the staggering costs associated with caring for Michiganders with dementia:
• $11,000 is the annual out-of-pocket cost for health care and long-term care for a person on Medicare with dementia — nearly twice the out-of-pocket costs of those caring for an adult without dementia.
• $321,780 was the total lifetime cost (in 2015 dollars) of caring for a person with dementia from the time of diagnosis.
• 517,000 people are caring for family members with dementia. They provide an estimated 589 million hours of unpaid care annually to people living with dementia. The value of this unpaid care is over $7 billion.

“Alzheimer’s is the most expensive disease in the United States,” said Jennifer Lepard, president and CEO of the Alzheimer’s Association, Greater Michigan Chapter and co-chair of the Michigan Dementia Coalition. “Given the enormous burden Alzheimer’s has on individuals living with the disease, their families and the country as a whole — it must remain a public health priority for Michigan and for our nation.”

An estimated 190,000 Michiganders age 65 and older have Alzheimer’s dementia, a number that is expected to swell to 220,000 people by 2025. While those numbers are rising, it's an underestimate of the larger problem because it doesn't include people who are younger than 65 with Alzheimer's disease or those who have other forms of dementia, such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington’s disease.

“Two-thirds of adults personally know someone who has had Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or another condition causing cognitive decline,” said Lisa Dedden Cooper, manager of advocacy for AARP Michigan and co-chair of the Michigan Dementia Coalition.

And although the data are grim, the coalition — made up of 65 organizations and 120 individuals, including AARP Michigan, the Alzheimer’s Association Michigan chapters, researchers at Michigan State University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, and the Area Agency on Aging 1B — is working on strategies to help the state better manage the rising number of people with dementia, and make their lives and the lives of their caregivers more fulfilling.
• Increase access to training, education and support for caregivers, health care and service providers
• Reduce turnover and improve job satisfaction among those who work in health care and those who provide services to dementia patients
• Promote early detection and diagnosis and expand opportunities for patients to take part in clinical research
• Meet the unmet need and prepare for increased future demand for services for people living with dementia
• Address the need for more affordable, reliable transportation services for people with dementia
• Identify policy and regulatory changes to help prevent abuse and financial exploitation of people with dementia

It's also trying to raise awareness about dementia and the care-giving challenges, building partnerships to strengthen services available to patients, and enacting policies that will make a difference for families and the state's economy.

469,HEALTH,"After learning a fellow staff member at Issaquah High School tested positive for measles, Julia Valvano-Knoppi scrambled Thursday to prove she was protected against the highly contagious disease.

The paraeducator called her mother, who had a clear memory of Valvano-Knoppi having measles as a toddler and then getting vaccinated anyway. Unable to find the 47-year-old documents, Valvano-Knoppi drove to her doctor’s office to get blood drawn, when the high school was closed.

On Thursday evening, she was still waiting for the results showing she has immunity.

Issaquah High will reopen Friday, but Valvano-Knoppi won’t be able to return until she can provide the district with documentation that she has been vaccinated.

“It was a surprise to hear that, out of all the places in the world for measles to pop up, it was the little town of Issaquah, at our high school,” she said. “I just hope and pray no one else is affected.”

The staff-member scramble is part of a larger response to a new measles outbreak affecting King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, which each had at least one case confirmed this week.

Health officials confirmed five new cases reported among people who spent time at sites throughout the Seattle area, including Issaquah High and North Creek High School in Bothell. It’s unclear where the people were exposed, but all were at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at some point during the period they were infected, health officials said.

In King County, officials have identified at least 22 exposure locations, which the patients visited when they were contagious but didn’t know they were infected, said Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health – Seattle & King County, at a Board of Health meeting Thursday. They’ve done daily checks on three-dozen people who were in close contact with the patients and sent hundreds of letters to businesses and schools. It’s required a lot of extra work within the department.

“It’s very challenging to reach people, and for them to remember where they have been a couple weeks ago, to try to recreate an itinerary,” Duchin said.

At Issaquah High, not enough staff members could provide documentation of immunization in time to ensure there would be enough staff members to open school Thursday, said district spokeswoman L. Michelle, so the classes were canceled Wednesday evening.

Only students in advanced-placement courses were allowed to come to the school to take scheduled tests with proctors who had provided documentation. Signs on the doors said “school closed for today … per public health.”

By Thursday afternoon, more than half the staff had provided verification, enough to reopen the building on Friday.

However, a dozen seniors, along with an undisclosed number of younger students, are barred from school for two weeks, because they haven’t been vaccinated. May 31 will be the last day they could show symptoms for measles. They’ll miss a chunk of their last days of high school, but will be able to attend graduation –as long as there are no other confirmed cases.

North Creek High School – where one student attended classes while contagious – remained open. The students and staff who didn’t have measles immunization records received letters saying they are excluded until May 31. The Northshore School District did not provide information on the number of people who received the letters.

The letter warned that almost anyone who has not had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) will contract measles if they are exposed to the measles virus.

At the board of health meeting, Duchin said that it’s important to not look at the outbreaks as a short-term issue even though 90 percent of kindergartners and 96 percent of sixth graders in Washington are are fully vaccinated against measles.

“This is going to be with us for a number of years,” he said. “The best thing to do is get vaccinated. There’s a very good preventative step we can all take.”

Valvano-Knoppi, the Issaquah paraeducator, said she plans to keep checking the website where her test results will be posted. Her doctor told her she would get in touch as soon as she heard anything.

“I’m thankful they have enough staff to open school tomorrow, and if I have to miss work, it’s just a small blip in the grand scheme of things,” she said. “I just want to get back to school for the kids.”","Amid measles outbreak, Issaquah High staff scramble to locate vaccine documentation"
470,HEALTH,"I am standing outside my childhood primary school, near the front gates and the teachers’ car park. It is a bright sunny day and I am surrounded by my classmates. There must be more than a hundred of us.

I have a dim feeling that some of my teachers are nearby, but my attention is on two adults, neither of which I recognise. The man I see in lurid detail – from the slick shine of his hair to the golden lenses on his sunglasses. He holds up some kind of device that emits a piercing shriek. I drop to my knees with my hands against my ears. My schoolmates are all doing the same. The man is laughing maniacally.

I had that dream nearly 40 years ago, but I can remember the details as if it were yesterday. Ask me to relate anything from a dream I had earlier this week, however, and I draw a blank. If I have been dreaming – and biology would suggest I most probably have – nothing has lingered long enough to remain in my waking mind.

• How to become a lucid dreamer
• The surprising truth about why we sleep

For many of us, dreams are an almost intangible presence. If we’re lucky, we can only remember the most fleeting glimpse in the cold light of day; even those of us who can recollect past dreams in astonishing detail can wake some days with almost no memory of what we had dreamed about.

There is little ethereal about the reasons this might be happening, however. Why we have dreams – and whether we can remember them – are both rooted in the biology of our sleeping bodies and subconscious mind.

Sleep is more complicated than we once thought. Rather than being a plateau of unconsciousness bookended by slipping in and out of sleep, our resting brains go through a rollercoaster of mental states, with some parts being full of mental activity.

Dreaming is most closely associated with the sleep state known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM). REM is sometimes known as desychronised sleep, because it can mimic some of the signs of being awake. In REM sleep, the eyes twitch rapidly, there are changes in breathing and circulation, and the body enters a paralysed state known as atonia. It happens in 90-minute-waves during sleep, and it’s at this stage that our brains tend to dream.

There is an extra flow of blood to crucial parts of our brain during the REM state: the cortex, which fills our dreams with their content, and the limbic system, which processes our emotional state. While we’re in this dream-friendly state of sleep, they fire with furious electrical activity. The frontal lobes, however – which direct our critical faculties – are quiet.

This means we often blindly accept what is happening in this often nonsensical narrative until the time comes to wake up.

The problem is, the more jumbled the imagery, the harder it is for us to grasp hold of. Dreams that have a clearer structure are much easier for us to remember, psychology professor and author Deidre Barrett said in a recent story on Gizmodo.

But there’s a chemical component at work which is crucial for making sure those dream images are retained: noradrenaline. Noradrenaline is a hormone that primes the body and mind for action, and our levels of it are naturally lower in deep sleep.

Francesca Siclari, a sleep research doctor at the Lausanne University Hospital, says there are clear definitions between our states of wake and sleep – and that is no accident. “It’s probably a good thing that the dream life and the waking life are completely different,” she says.

“I think if you remembered every detail like you can do in waking life, you would start to confuse things with what’s actually happening in your real life.”

She says that people suffering from sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, can find it difficult to tell the difference between their waking and sleeping lives, and this can leave them feeling confused and embarrassed. “There are also people who remember their dreams too well, and they actually start exporting those memories into their day.”

It is no accident that the dreams we remember the most come from certain periods in our sleep cycle, affected by the chemicals coursing through our sleeping bodies. “Normally we dream most vividly in REM sleep, which is when the levels of noradrenaline are low in the brain,” she says.

We may find ourselves dreaming right before we wake up – but our morning routines actually get in the way of remembering the imagery. Often we are startled out of our slumber by an alarm clock, which causes a spike in our noradrenaline levels – thus making it harder for us to hang onto our dreams.

“Someone who asks me the question of why they can’t remember their dreams, I say it’s because they fall asleep too fast, sleep too soundly and wake up with their alarm clock,” says Harvard Medical School sleep researcher Robert Stickgold. “And their response is usually, ‘How did you know that?’”

Stickgold says that a lot of people remember their dreams from a sleep onset period, when the mind starts wandering and dreamlike imagery occurs as people drift in and out of sleep – a process called “hypnagogic dreaming”. Stickgold says he carried out a study some years ago where students in a lab were awoken shortly after they started entering this state. “Every last one of them remembered dreaming,” he says.

“This stage is the first five or 10 minutes after falling asleep. If you just fall fast asleep – the way we all wish we could – you’re not going to remember anything from that part of your sleep cycle.”

So what if you actively want to remember your dreams? Obviously, each sleeper is different, but there are some general tips which might help you to hold on to your dreams.

“Dreams are incredibly fragile when we first wake up, and we don’t really have an answer for why that is,” says Stickgold. “If you’re the kind of person who leaps up out of bed and goes about their day, you’re not going to remember your dreams. When you sleep in on a Saturday or Sunday morning, that’s an excellent time to remember dreams.

“What I tell my students on my courses is, when you wake up, try to lie still – don’t even open your eyes. Try to ‘float’ and at the same time try to remember what was in your dream. What you’re doing is you’re reviewing dreams as you enter your waking state and you’ll remember them just like any other memory.”

There are even more surefire ways to remember dreams, Stickgold says. “I tell people to drink three big glasses of water before they go to bed. Not three glasses of beer, because alcohol in an REM suppressant, but water. You’ll wake up three or four times in the night and you’ll tend to wake up at the end of an REM cycle of sleep which is natural.”

And there is another piece of advice offered by some sleep researchers – that simply repeating to yourself as you drift towards sleep that you want to remember your dreams means you wake remembering them. Stickgold laughs. “It actually works. If you do that you really are going to remember more dreams, it’s like saying ‘There’s no place like home’. It really works.”

471,HEALTH,"Prominent genetic ""biohacker"" Josiah Zayner is under investigation by California state officials for practicing medicine without a license.

Zayner has a background in biophysics and runs a company called The Odin, which sells do-it-yourself genetic engineering kits and other lab equipment intended for use outside of scientific laboratories. The kits and tools are intended to allow lay users to genetically modify bacteria, yeast, animals, and even humans.

The human that Zayner's products are best known for trying to modify is Zayner himself. In fact, the brazen CEO has a long history of self-experimentation. In 2016, he attempted a stomach-churning DIY fecal transplant in an airport hotel, then moved on to trying to genetically engineer his skin.

But he is perhaps best known for an alcohol-fueled stunt he livestreamed in October 2017. Between swigs of Scotch, he injected himself in the arm with what he said was the DNA for the genetic engineering tool CRISPR. The stated goal was for the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery to snip and disable Zayner's myostatin gene, which is involved with muscle-growth regulation before and after birth. Disabling the gene could leave him with beefy muscle growth.

But Zayner admitted—and outside experts agreed—that the experiment was unlikely to work. It's unclear if the genetic material made its way into Zayner's cells and, if so, how many and to what effect. Most of the research on myostatin has been done in animals.

In an interview with Buzzfeed directly after the October 2017 muscle-editing stunt, Zayner told the outlet, ""I want to live in a world where people get drunk and instead of giving themselves tattoos, they're like, 'I'm drunk, I'm going to CRISPR myself.'""

But by February of 2018, he took a sober stance. Other biohackers had begun performing similar self-injection stunts, and Zayner expressed regret. ""Honestly, I kind of blame myself,"" he told The Atlantic. ""There's no doubt in my mind that somebody is going to end up hurt eventually,"" he said. Still, Zayner has continued to sell his DIY genetic engineering kits.

The biohacking community wasn't alone in taking notice of Zayner's antics, however. Weeks after his CRISPR injection, the Food and Drug Administration weighed in, calling genetic-editing kits illegal. (Zayner had a run-in with the FDA back in 2016, too, for selling kits to brew glow-in-the-dark alcoholic beverages). In a notice about the human gene-editing kits, the FDA wrote:

Now, officials in Zayner's home state of California have also taken notice. According to a May 8, 2019, letter Zayner posted to his Instagram account on Wednesday, health investigators at the Department of Consumer Affairs are following up on a complaint alleging Zayner is practicing medicine without a license. The investigators are ""now at the point in our review where we would like to discuss this matter with you,"" it read. They requested an interview and noted, ""We will be discussing your business.""

On the social media site, Zayner responded, saying that the investigation stemmed from his ""genetic self-experimentation"" for the purpose of ""showing people how to access publicly available knowledge."" He continued:

The truth is that I have never given anyone anything to inject or use, never sold any material meant to treat a disease, and never claim to provide treatments or cures because I knew this day would come. The f***** up part is that so many people are dying not because of me but because the FDA and government refuses to allow people access to cutting-edge treatments or in some cases even basic healthcare. Yet I am the one threatened with jail.

Practicing medicine without a valid license in California can be tried as either a misdemeanor or a felony, with penalties up to a $10,000 fine and three years in prison. Zayner concluded on Twitter: ""Yeah, I need to find a lawyer.""

In a comment to Ars, Zayner added only: ""I can't believe the government is spending time investigating me when they could be helping leak spoilers to Rick & Morty season 4. Ya' know?""

472,HEALTH,"HEBER CITY, Utah — A family is warning others after their son fell ill with the mumps virus, despite being up to date on his immunizations.

“I would consider this the worst sickness I’ve had,” said 11-year-old Finn Price.

The fifth grader was sick last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

“My jaw really, really hurt,” Finn said. “Chewing a lot of harder, crunchy foods was out of the question. The fever didn’t help at all.”

At first, doctors didn’t diagnose Finn with mumps. When a test returned a positive result, he and his parents were shocked.

“C’mon, he can’t have the mumps,” said Finn’s mom, Bethe Price, when asked about her reaction to the test result.

She wants families to know the mumps vaccine isn’t 100% effective.

“Unfortunately, vaccines like everything else in this world, is not a guarantee,” said Dr. Mary Tipton, a pediatrician at Copper View Medical Center.

Tipton emphasizes the importance of vaccinations in preventing large outbreaks of dangerous diseases.

Finn’s parents plan to make sure he gets any needed boosters.

“I don’t see the point in not having immunizations,” Kyle Price, Finn’s father, said.

“Definitely get your kids immunized. We’ll keep doing that, for sure,” said Bethe Price.

The Wasatch County Health Department released a statement, warning families with children at Old Mill Elementary of possible exposure.

The virus has an incubation period of up to 18 days, so there is a chance people may have contracted it and not yet be aware.

473,HEALTH,"NORTH FULTON COUNTY, Ga. - Georgia health officials are putting restaurants on alert after a hepatitis A outbreak has made more than 300 people sick this year, nearly 100 of them in the last month.

Officials are calling Fulton County and northwest Georgia ""hotspots"" for new cases.

Channel 2 Action News has learned that some of those cases involved restaurant workers. The highlycontagious liver disease is usually transmitted through contaminated food and drink.

Channel 2's Carol Sbarge learned what steps they are taking to keep restaurant patrons safe.

The Georgia Restaurant Association recently sent a letter statewide reminding restaurant employees about the rules regarding handwashing after using the restroom and not touching food without gloves.

Officials said only a few restaurant workers have been linked to the outbreak, so the risk is minimal. Officials said safety measures in restaurants keep the risk of transmission of diseases like hepatitis A low.

""We don't think of food workers as posing a widespread risk at all to the public,"" one official said.

474,HEALTH,"You know how annoying it is when you’re walking down the street and someone is just dawdling in front of you like they don’t have a care in the world.

Like, you’re in a rush to get to work or you’re just walking at a normal pace to get anywhere and that one person will just be holding you up for no reason other than they’re being slow AF.

Well, now the jokes on them because research has shown fast walkers live up to 15 years longer than people who dawdle. An entire 15 years! They’re not messing about, are they.

The research, carried out by a team at Leicester University, analysed data from 474,919 people with an average age of 52 in the UK between 2006 and 2016.

The team found that, regardless of weight, those with a habitually fast walking pace have a long life expectancy – from underweight to morbidly obese.

Women who walked briskly had a life expectancy of 86.7 to 87.8 years old, whereas women who walked at a slower pace had a life expectancy of 72.4. Mens’ life expectancy dropped even lower; from 85.2 to 86.8 years at a fast pace to just 64.8 for slow walkers.

This is the first time research has associated fast walking pace with a longer life expectancy regardless of a person’s body weight or obesity status.

Professor Tom Yates, lead author of the study from the University of Leicester, said in a statement:

Our findings could help clarify the relative importance of physical fitness compared to body weight on life expectancy of individuals. In other words, the findings suggest that perhaps physical fitness is a better indicator of life expectancy than body mass index (BMI), and that encouraging the population to engage in brisk walking may add years to their lives.

The research took data from the UK Biobank and was analysed by the National Institute for Health Research, Leicester Hospitals and the Universities of Leicester and Loughborough.

Dr Francesco Zaccardi, clinical epidemiologist at the Leicester Diabetes Centre and co-author of the study, said:

Studies published so far have mainly shown the impact of body weight and physical fitness on mortality in terms of relative risk, for example a 20 per cent relative increase of risk of death for every 5 kilograms per metres squared increase, compared to a reference value of a BMI of 25 kilograms per metres squared (the threshold BMI between normal weight and overweight). However, it is not always easy to interpret a ‘relative risk’. Reporting in terms of life expectancy, conversely, is easier to interpret and gives a better idea of the separate and joint importance of body mass index and physical fitness.

Right guys, that’s it. I want all of you to take a break from whatever you’re doing and go for a brisk walk immediately.

475,HEALTH,"Synthetic proteins have been created that move in response to their environment in predictable and tunable ways. These motile molecules were designed from scratch on computers, then produced inside living cells.

To function, natural proteins often shift their shapes in precise ways. For example, the blood protein hemoglobin must flex as it binds to and releases a molecule of oxygen. Achieving similar molecular movement by design, however, has been a long-standing challenge.

The May 17 issue of Science reports the successful design of molecules that change shape in response to pH changes. (pH is a chemical scale from basic to acidic.)

The Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington School of Medicine led the multi-institutional research.

The researchers set out to create synthetic proteins that self-assemble into designed configurations at neutral pH and quickly disassemble in the presence of acid.

The results showed that these dynamic proteins move as intended and can use their pH-dependent movement to disrupt lipid membranes, including those on the endosome, an important compartment inside cells.

This membrane-disruptive ability could be useful in improving drug action. Bulky drug molecules delivered to cells often get lodged in endosomes. Stuck there, they can't carry out their intended therapeutic effect.

The acidity of endosomes differs from the rest of the cell. This pH difference acts as a signal that triggers the movement of the design molecules, thereby enabling them to disrupt the endosome membrane.

""The ability to design synthetic proteins that move in predictable ways is going to enable a new wave of molecular medicines,"" said senior author David Baker, professor of biochemistry at the UW School of Medicine and director of the Institute for Protein Design. ""Because these molecules can permeabilize endosomes, they have great promise as new tools for drug delivery.""

""Disrupting membranes can be toxic, so it's important that these proteins activate only under the right conditions and at the right time, once they're inside the endosome,"" said Scott Boyken, a recent postdoctoral fellow in the Baker lab and lead author on the recent project.

Boyken achieved molecular motion in his designer proteins by incorporating a chemical called histidine. In neutral (neither basic nor acidic) conditions, histidine carries no electric charge. In the presence of a small amount of acid, it picks up positive charge. This stops it from participating in certain chemical interactions. This chemical property of histidine allowed the team to create protein assemblies that fall apart in the presence of acid.

""Designing new proteins with moving parts has been a long-term goal of my postdoctoral work. Because we designed these proteins from scratch, we were able to control the exact number and location of the histidines,"" said Boyken. ""This let us tune the proteins to fall apart at different levels of acidity.""

Other scientists from the UW, The Ohio State University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus contributed to this research.

Those in Vicki Wysocki's Group at OSU used native mass spectrometry to determine the amount of acid needed to cause disassembly of the proteins. They confirmed the design hypothesis that having more histidines at interfaces between the proteins would cause the assemblies to collapse more suddenly.

Collaborators in the Kelly Lee lab at the UW School of Pharmacy showed that the designer proteins disrupt artificial membranes in a pH-dependent manner that mirrors the behavior of natural membrane fusion proteins.

Follow-up experiments conducted in Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz's lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus showed that the proteins also disrupt endosomal membranes in mammalian cells.

Re-engineered viruses that can escape endosomes are the most commonly used drug delivery vehicles, but viruses have limitations and downsides. The researchers believe a drug delivery system made only of designer proteins could rival the efficiency of viral delivery without the inherent drawbacks.",Designing biological movement on the nanometer scale
476,HEALTH,"This year is supposed to be rough for ticks. Doctors are warning that because of the wet spring we have had so far, the conditions are perfect for them to be out.

""I have no doubt we are going to have a heavy tick season,"" said Dr. Thomas Rushton, an Infectious Diseases Specialist with St. Mary's Medical Center. ""It is perfect for that. We know that eggs that we laid over the winter are really going to start hatching whenever we get those first rains, so right where we are right now.""

Dr. Rushton says the weather is also helping the grass to grow and leaves are on the trees, which gives ticks something to hang onto.

Because this is going to be a bad tick season, doctors are urging you to check yourself, your kids and your pets anytime you come inside from being outdoors.

There are several places you should check when you are looking for ticks.

""You want to look at the nape of the hair, so wherever there is a hairline,"" Dr. Rushton said. ""You want to look very closely because it may look like it's a little skin abrasion or a mole, but if it's a tick and you touch it. those legs are going to move. You may need a magnifying glass. You want to look at crevasses, so skin folds are also places where ticks would like to be. It does take some time for that tick to actually find a spot that she likes, bite and embed, so we want to remove all ticks within 24 hours.""

Doctors say you should also check your clothes. When you go out, make sure you are using insect repellent. You can also wear light-colored clothing and long pants and shirts to keep them away from your skin.

Ali Shehl says now that she knows this tick season is going to be bad, she is going to be changing her routine with her family when they come in each day.

""Now that I know it's going to be bad, I am going to check my kids more,"" Shehl said. ""We try to check Ruby every time she rolls around in the grass because we have found some on her before.""

Although doctors say only about 10 percent of ticks carry diseases, you still need to be keeping an eye on any bite you get.

478,HEALTH,"Biomedical-research funder the Wellcome Trust has announced an ambitious initiative to improve the treatment of snakebites in poor countries. Snakebites kill tens of thousands of people a year, partly because they are treated with archaic antivenoms that often work only for one species.

Wellcome’s £80-million (US$103-million) programme, announced on 16 May, aims to improve existing therapies and will also support the development of antivenoms that can treat the toxins of different snake species.

“After many years of neglect, the tragic global threat of snakebite is fortunately now receiving significantly greater attention,” says Mark Feinberg, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which also supports research into snakebite treatments.

Snakebites are a daily concern in many tropical and sub-tropical regions. The World Health Organization (WHO), which is due to publish a strategy on snakebite on 23 May, estimates that between 81,000 and 138,000 people die from snakebites each year. People in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa and India who have limited access to hospitals and medication are most at risk.

Snakebites have historically received little attention from researchers and policymakers, and few new treatments have been developed. Existing antivenoms rely on antibodies made by injecting large animals such as horses with small amounts of snake venom. They must also be refrigerated and administered by intravenous injection or infusion under the supervision of a doctor, making t﻿reatment in the field difficult.

High-quality antivenoms are also expensive to make, often work only against the species of snake from which the venom was taken and can cause dangerous side effects, such as potentially fatal allergic reactions. In sub-Saharan Africa, a hotspot of the snakebite crisis, the drugs are in short supply — and even when hospitals have them, they are often ineffective against local snake species.

Wellcome — together with medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (also known as Doctors Without Borders) and local partners — plans to establish a pan-African network of clinical trials carefully designed to test promising new drug candidates in people, says Phillip Price, who leads snakebite science at the Wellcome Trust in London.

Tools of genomics, immunology and structural biology promise to deliver much more effective treatments than those currently available, says Feinberg. Scientists have already discovered that certain molecules inhibit the toxic activity of venom from carpet vipers (Echis ocellatus) in Cameroon and Ghana. Other approaches rely on mixtures of certain human antibodies that can neutralize neurotoxins of the extremely venomous black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis).

Synthetic biology also offers hope. Antivenoms based on human antibodies can be produced at roughly the same costs as animal-derived antivenoms, says Andreas Laustsen, a biotechnologist at the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby. “We need to find antibodies that neutralize toxins in the venom of a great variety of snakes,” he says. “Here’s a real research need that Wellcome could address.”

Other research efforts under way focus on developing drugs that people could take in the field right after a bite. Such medicines, some of which are being developed at Ophirex, a company in Corte Madera, California, would be a breakthrough, says Price.

The firm hopes to start a clinical trial in New Guinea next year. Snakebites in that country are predominately from taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus), whose venom causes general or respiratory paralysis. Being able to reliably test new drugs in African countries, which host a large variety of endemic venomous snakes, would be immense progress, says Ophirex chief scientist Matthew Lewin. Wellcome’s coordinated programme ﻿could bring rigour to these complex international projects, he says.",Snakebite crisis gets US$100-million boost for better antivenoms
479,HEALTH,"In a world first, researchers from The Australian National University (ANU) have shown previously ignored rare genetic mutations are a major cause of lupus.

The discovery is set to change our understanding of the causes of disease and potentially save lives.

Lupus is an autoimmune disease that has no cure. It targets the body's healthy tissue, causing inflammation, damage and pain.

Until now, the exact cause of the disease has been poorly understood.

That's changed thanks to a genetic breakthrough by ANU researchers Dr. Simon Jiang, Dr. Vicki Athanasopoulos, and Professor Carola Vinuesa.

Dr. Jiang has spent six years analysing the genetic instructions locked in DNA which lead to the disease.

""We have shown for the first time how rare gene variants that occur in less than one percent of the population cause lupus and how these variants drive the disease in the body,"" said Dr. Jiang, from the Centre for Personalised Immunology, an NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence at ANU.

""Until now, it was thought that these rare variants played a negligible role in human autoimmunity and related autoimmune diseases.

""We've shown how most lupus patients harbour those so-called rare gene variants and how these rare gene variants cause immune cells to no longer work properly.

""When the cells no longer work, your immune system struggles to distinguish viruses and bacteria from self, leading to lupus.""

The finding makes way for life-saving personalised treatment for lupus and other autoimmune diseases.

""There is huge potential for targeted treatment,"" said Dr. Jiang.

""I've already started treating people who have these rare gene mutations with targeted therapies instead of bombarding their immune system with non-specific treatments that have lots of side effects—which is the current mainstay of therapy.

""And because the genes we have worked on are linked to other autoimmune diseases, our discovery could also be applied to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes.""

The finding may also help identify and predict how severe an individual's lupus is.

""Lupus is a disease that can be very hard to diagnose. You can have a lot of illnesses that look like lupus, smell like lupus, but we can't formally call it lupus.

""It now will only take a few weeks to get a patient's genome sequence. We can look at how the immune system is behaving, take blood tests and with genome sequencing we can fit the pieces together and see if it is lupus.""

Dr. Jiang says the discovery is a personal victory because he has seen so many people suffering from lupus.

""When I was a junior doctor, I had a patient in her 40s who died because of an autoimmune condition and we just could not figure out what was wrong. That shouldn't happen and it affected me a lot. I'd like to think if she came to me nowadays I'd be able to do something different. I hope I'd be able to save her life.""",Groundbreaking genetic discovery shows why Lupus develops

Ed Henthorn said it had caused him erectile dysfunction, psychosis and suicidal thoughts.

And one man who believes his son killed himself after taking the drug said the risks ""are just too high"".

Manufacturer Roche said ""millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"".

The majority of those who take the drug have a positive experience.

""I used to think about girls... but my feelings, thoughts, just faded away,"" Ed Henthorn told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

He was 19 when he took Roaccutane. He describes his acne as mild but bad enough to want to treat.

After three weeks he started to experience side-effects, including reduced energy and sex drive.

""That was why I decided to stop taking it,"" he said.

What does the NHS say about Roaccutane?

In its guidance about the options available for acne treatment, the NHS says Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments.

The NHS acknowledges there have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking the drug. Its advice says, while there is no evidence these changes were caused by Roaccutane, patients should speak to their doctor immediately if they feel depressed or anxious, or if they have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.

Roaccutane, the brand name the drug isotretinoin is most commonly marketed under, is used by about 30,000 people in the UK each year.

Campaigners want it banned from NHS prescriptions, arguing its continuing side-effects mean its risks outweigh the benefits.

Mr Henthorn said he still suffers five years after his last dose.

He said it had thwarted his hopes of completing university and pursuing a career.

""I had psychosis, psychotic symptoms, suicidal thoughts. It was pretty overwhelming,"" he added.

""My life now is not the best. I'm just kind of at home. The drug's just turned my life upside down.""

Warnings about depression and other psychiatric side-effects were added to the drug's patient information leaflet in 1998.

Two years ago, a new warning was added to say some people would be affected by problems getting or maintaining an erection and lower libido.

But Roche said while Roaccutane had side-effects - ""like most medications... millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"".

It added: ""Isotretinoin was a prescription-only medicine and therefore can only be safely used under the care and supervision of suitably qualified healthcare professionals.

""This way, specialists with the most experience can advise patients about the important safety issues associated with isotretinoin.""

Another version of the drug is marketed by Alliance.

It said it continually assessed the benefits and risks of its medicines.

Many people say it has boosted their self esteem and mental health by treating the acne.

""I would go as far as to say it's a wonder drug,"" she says. ""I feel so much happier. I'm confident in my own skin.""

Dematologist Dr Juber Hafiji said it was a very effective treatment for acne.

""In experienced hands it's a very safe treatment, providing the patient is monitored closely, with regular supervision and blood tests at intervals,"" he said.

David Healy, professor of psychology at Bangor University, said there were many other drugs that could affect someone's ability to have sex.

But the issue with Roaccutane, he added, was how serious the problem could be and how long it could last for.

""It's very, very, important the label makes it clear that these problems can be enduring and also makes it clear that they may only appear after you stop the drug,"" he said.

The safety of drugs is governed by the MHRA, and the NHS drug approval body NICE follows its advice.

NICE is planning to publish guidance on all acne treatments by 2021 and said it always considered the safety of drugs in its guidelines.

The drug can be prescribed in Scotland, although the Scottish Medicines Consortium said it would not have assessed Roaccutane because it predates the creation of the SMC.

Derek Jones's son Jesse had two courses of Roaccutane, and experienced side-effects in relation to his sex drive.

It led him to take Viagra, aged 24.

The coroner at Jesse's inquest recorded a narrative verdict. His use of Roaccutane was not considered as a contributing factor.

But Mr Jones believes his son took his own life.

In a draft email found by his parents, Jesse had written: ""Roaccutane seems to have changed the way my mind and body works in a big way.

""I can barely bring myself to type its name because I hate it so much.""

Mr Jones, like other campaigners, believes the drug is too dangerous to be prescribed on the NHS.

""A minority get these terrible, terrible side-effects that affect them for the rest of their lives,"" he said.

""Should we just ignore this minority group? I think the risks are just too high.""

Roche said: ""Isotretinoin product information carries a clear warning that some patients may experience loss of libido and mood changes, including an increase in depression.""

It added research by the British Medical Research in 2010 had not established ""an observed increased risk of suicide"" and that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] had concluded in 2014 it was not possible to identify a clear increase in risk of psychiatric disorders.

It also said continuing safety reviews in Europe had suggested a causal relationship between isotretinoin, sexual dysfunction and depression was still unclear.

An MHRA spokeswoman said it kept the safety of the drug under review, with only consultant dermatologists who had a full understanding of its risks and monitoring requirements able to prescribe it.

They added: ""As with all medicines, isotretinoin can cause side effects and these are detailed in the product information provided with the medicine. The possible side effects should be discussed with patients before they are prescribed it.""

481,HEALTH,"When making a complex decision, we often break the problem down into a series of smaller decisions. For example, when deciding how to treat a patient, a doctor may go through a hierarchy of steps—choosing a diagnostic test, interpreting the results, and then prescribing a medication.

Making hierarchical decisions is straightforward when the sequence of choices leads to the desired outcome. But when the result is unfavorable, it can be tough to decipher what went wrong. For example, if a patient doesn't improve after treatment, there are many possible reasons why: Maybe the diagnostic test is accurate only 75 percent of the time, or perhaps the medication only works for 50 percent of the patients. To decide what do to next, the doctor must take these probabilities into account.

In a new study, MIT neuroscientists explored how the brain reasons about probable causes of failure after a hierarchy of decisions. They discovered that the brain performs two computations using a distributed network of areas in the frontal cortex. First, the brain computes confidence over the outcome of each decision to figure out the most likely cause of a failure, and second, when it is not easy to discern the cause, the brain makes additional attempts to gain more confidence.

""Creating a hierarchy in one's mind and navigating that hierarchy while reasoning about outcomes is one of the exciting frontiers of cognitive neuroscience,"" says Mehrdad Jazayeri, the Robert A. Swanson Career Development Professor of Life Sciences, a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study.

MIT graduate student Morteza Sarafyzad is the lead author of the paper, which appears in Science on May 16.

Previous studies of decision-making in animal models have focused on relatively simple tasks. One line of research has focused on how the brain makes rapid decisions by evaluating momentary evidence. For example, a large body of work has characterized the neural substrates and mechanisms that allow animals to categorize unreliable stimuli on a trial-by-trial basis. Other research has focused on how the brain chooses among multiple options by relying on previous outcomes across multiple trials.

""These have been very fruitful lines of work,"" Jazayeri says. ""However, they really are the tip of the iceberg of what humans do when they make decisions. As soon as you put yourself in any real decision-making situation, be it choosing a partner, choosing a car, deciding whether to take this drug or not, these become really complicated decisions. Oftentimes there are many factors that influence the decision, and those factors can operate at different timescales.""

The MIT team devised a behavioral task that allowed them to study how the brain processes information at multiple timescales to make decisions. The basic design was that animals would make one of two eye movements depending on whether the time interval between two flashes of light was shorter or longer than 850 milliseconds.

A twist required the animals to solve the task through hierarchical reasoning: The rule that determined which of the two eye movements had to be made switched covertly after 10 to 28 trials. Therefore, to receive reward, the animals had to choose the correct rule, and then make the correct eye movement depending on the rule and interval. However, because the animals were not instructed about the rule switches, they could not straightforwardly determine whether an error was caused because they chose the wrong rule or because they misjudged the interval.

The researchers used this experimental design to probe the computational principles and neural mechanisms that support hierarchical reasoning. Theory and behavioral experiments in humans suggest that reasoning about the potential causes of errors depends in large part on the brain's ability to measure the degree of confidence in each step of the process. ""One of the things that is thought to be critical for hierarchical reasoning is to have some level of confidence about how likely it is that different nodes [of a hierarchy] could have led to the negative outcome,"" Jazayeri says.

The researchers were able to study the effect of confidence by adjusting the difficulty of the task. In some trials, the interval between the two flashes was much shorter or longer than 850 milliseconds. These trials were relatively easy and afforded a high degree of confidence. In other trials, the animals were less confident in their judgments because the interval was closer to the boundary and difficult to discriminate.

As they had hypothesized, the researchers found that the animals' behavior was influenced by their confidence in their performance. When the interval was easy to judge, the animals were much quicker to switch to the other rule when they found out they were wrong. When the interval was harder to judge, the animals were less confident in their performance and applied the same rule a few more times before switching.

""They know that they're not confident, and they know that if they're not confident, it's not necessarily the case that the rule has changed. They know they might have made a mistake [in their interval judgment],"" Jazayeri says.

By recording neural activity in the frontal cortex just after each trial was finished, the researchers were able to identify two regions that are key to hierarchical decision-making. They found that both of these regions, known as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC), became active after the animals were informed about an incorrect response. When the researchers analyzed the neural activity in relation to the animals' behavior, it became clear that neurons in both areas signaled the animals' belief about a possible rule switch. Notably, the activity related to animals' belief was ""louder"" when animals made a mistake after an easy trial, and after consecutive mistakes.

The researchers also found that while these areas showed similar patterns of activity, it was activity in the ACC in particular that predicted when the animal would switch rules, suggesting that ACC plays a central role in switching decision strategies. Indeed, the researchers found that direct manipulation of neural activity in ACC was sufficient to interfere with the animals' rational behavior.

""There exists a distributed circuit in the frontal cortex involving these two areas, and they seem to be hierarchically organized, just like the task would demand,"" Jazayeri says.",Neuroscientists identify a brain circuit that helps break complex decisions down into smaller pieces

Deschutes County Public Health said Thursday it has confirmed four cases of pertussis (whooping cough) in the community, one in an adult and three in high school students -- two at Summit High School and one at Bend High School.

Pertussis can be a serious illness and is one of the most commonly occurring vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States, officials said. Infants and medically fragile children are at the highest risk of serious illness and, in rare cases, death.

""The best defense against pertussis is a well-immunized community,"" the county's announcement stated. DTaP and Tdap vaccines are readily available through your local health care provider and many pharmacies. Deschutes County Health Services also offers vaccinations; call (541) 322-7400 to make an appointment.

Health officials said the four people who contracted pertussis had been vaccinated, though they noted the effectiveness wanes somewhat over time. It remains roughly 80 to 90 percent effective, but booster shots are recommended for some people.

Initial symptoms of pertussis in older children and adults are similar to those of a cold, and commonly include a runny nose, sneezing and a severe cough.

Over the course of a few days, the cough will usually worsen and can be followed by spasms and occasionally vomiting. Infants commonly demonstrate more severe symptoms, which may include:

The county said anyone with symptoms similar to those described above should seek a medical evaluation to rule out pertussi.

If pertussis is suspected and antibiotics are prescribed, officials said you should not attend school or work until you have completed a minimum of five days of the prescribed medication.",Deschutes County confirms four pertussis cases

485,HEALTH,"Looking for a way to stay mentally sharp as you age? Here’s a clue: puzzles.

Indeed, two papers published Thursday in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry conclude that adults over 50 who regularly do word and number puzzles like crosswords and Sudoku have better brain function. And the more you do the puzzles, the better your brain function.

The research, which examined more than 19,000 people, was led by researchers at the University of Exeter and King’s College London. The researchers asked the participants how often they did puzzles (the response options were more than once a day, once a day, once a week, once a month to occasionally and never) and then performed cognitive tests on them focusing on attention, information processing, executive function, working memory and episodic memory.

“We’ve found that the more regularly people engage with puzzles such as crosswords and Sudoku, the sharper their performance is across a range of tasks assessing memory, attention and reasoning,” wrote lead researcher Anne Corbett of the University of Exeter Medical School. “The improvements are particularly clear in the speed and accuracy of their performance.”

And the results were especially pronounced on tests of grammatical reasoning, where those who do puzzles more than once a day had brain function equivalent to those about 10 years younger, and approximated those eight years younger on short-term-memory tests.

So how often should you do puzzles? “We would recommend doing them daily if you can, but the message is that every little [bit] helps,” Corbett tells Marketwatch. “We saw the greatest impact in people who complete puzzles more than once a day.”

Of course, this doesn’t prove causality, but it’s not the only research to show a relationship between engagement with puzzles and mental games and mental acuity. Indeed, a 2011 study published in the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society concluded: “Participation in crossword puzzles delayed the onset of accelerated memory decline in subjects who developed dementia by 2.54 years compared to non-puzzlers.”

These aren’t the only ways you might be able to prevent cognitive decline as you age, either. Eating right can help, too: A study earlier this year found that people who ate two servings or more of mushrooms per week could reduce their risk of cognitive decline by up to 50%. Other foods that may help keep you sharp: blueberries, fish and nuts.

And Harvard Medical School notes that there is also evidence to suggest that exercise, sleep and regular social interaction may be helpful, as well.",Older adults who do this have the brain function of people a decade younger
486,HEALTH,"Discovery by NIAID-funded researchers could aid quest for universal flu vaccine.

The ever-changing “head” of an influenza virus protein has an unexpected Achilles heel, report scientists funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the National Institutes of Health. The team discovered and characterized the structure of a naturally occurring human antibody that recognizes and disrupts a portion of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that the virus uses to enter and infect cells. The investigators determined that the antibody, FluA-20, binds tightly to an area on the globular head of the HA protein that is only very briefly accessible to antibody attack. The site was not expected to be vulnerable to such a strike.

James E. Crowe, Jr., M.D., of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, and Ian A. Wilson, D. Phil., of The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, California, led the team. They isolated FluA-20 antibody from a person who had received many influenza immunizations. In a series of experiments, they showed that FluA-20 can “reach into” an otherwise inaccessible part of the three-part HA trimer molecule and cause it to fall apart, thus preventing the spread of virus from cell to cell. This discovery came as a surprise because this region of trimeric HA was thought to be stable and inaccessible to antibodies. Moreover, this region — unlike the rest of HA’s head — varies little from strain to strain. In theory, antibody-based therapeutics directed at that precise region would be effective against many strains of influenza A virus. Similarly, vaccines designed to elicit antibodies against this target might provide long-lasting protection against any influenza strain, potentially eliminating the need for annual seasonal influenza vaccination.

In mouse studies, FluA-20 prevented infection or illness when the animals were exposed to four different influenza A viral subtypes that cause disease in humans. Two viruses used in the experiments, H1N1 and H5N1, are Group 1 influenza subtypes, while the two others, H3N2 and H7N9, are members of Group 2. Current influenza vaccines must contain viral components from both subtypes to elicit matching antibodies. A single vaccine able to generate potent antibodies against members of both groups could provide broad multi-year protection against influenza.

Researchers looked at the most nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables to see which provided meaningful amounts of B vitamins including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B6 and B12, vitamins C and K, iron, fiber, and protein. Most of the top spots on their ranked list of powerhouse fruits — those most strongly associated with reducing the risk of chronic diseases — were various citrus fruits with one popular berry mixed in.

As terrific as blueberries are considered, blackberries were actually the next fruit on the list, followed by white grapefruit. Now this isn't to say that blueberries, which many studies rank very high for antioxidants and other healthful compounds, shouldn't be on your shopping list along with raspberries. Eating fruits in a rainbow of colors gets you the widest variety of nutrients and phyto-nutrients — those hard-to-duplicate compounds that go beyond vitamins and minerals.

It's also important to pay attention to a fruit's ripeness. Studies show that ripe fruits, including all berries, offer more antioxidants than fruits that are not quite ready. Based on that criteria, strawberries topped the list, followed by black raspberries, blackberries, and red raspberries in that order.

So did his ability to focus and retain information. Rhodes was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury, or TBI.

""I wanted to fix it right now, today, what the problem was. That's what soldiers do,"" Rhoades said.

Most people recover from mild TBI. But about 15% continue to experience symptoms, which include mental health problems like depression and cognitive changes, including problems with memory and attention. Since 2000, nearly 400,000 service members have been diagnosed with TBI.

""It's really a public health concern,"" said Dr. Louis French, who studies traumatic brain injury at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

French and his team are testing a computerized brain training program to see if it could be part of a comprehensive treatment program for those with TBI.

Eighty three service members and veterans diagnosed with TBI and cognitive impairment did five hours a week of either a program called BrainHQ or computer games. Preliminary results presented at a conference Thursday found after 12 weeks, those in the brain training program scored better than the game players on tests of cognitive function, but not on tasks of daily living like finding food items on a shelf.
